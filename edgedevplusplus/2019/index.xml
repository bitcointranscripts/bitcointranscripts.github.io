Introduction I am pretty sure you can tell but I am not James (Chiang). I am taking over the functional testing framework talk from James. He has already given several great talks. I took over this talk at very short notice from James. I’d like to give a hands on talk.
Content This is a brief introduction into the functional testing framework.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain Design Patterns: Layers and scaling approaches</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/blockchain-design-patterns/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/blockchain-design-patterns/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171400374336536576
Introduction Alright. Are we ready to get going? Thumbs up? Alright. Cool. I am Andrew and this is David. We&amp;rsquo;re here to talk about blockchain design patterns: layers and scaling approaches. This will be a tour of a bunch of different scaling approaches in bitcoin in particular but it&amp;rsquo;s probably applicable to other blockchains out there. Our talk is in 3 parts. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about some existing scaling tech and related things like caching transactions and mempool propagation.</description></item><item><title>Challenges of developing bOSminer from scratch in Rust</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/bosminer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/bosminer/</guid><description>https://braiins-os.org/

Introduction Good morning everyone. My task is to talk about the challenges we faced while we were implementing a replacement for the cgminer software. We&amp;rsquo;re doing it in rust. Essentially, I would like to cover a little bit of the history and to give some credit to ck for his hard work.
cgminer cgminer used to be a CPU miner that has been functionally removed a long time ago.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/debugging-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/debugging-bitcoin/</guid><description>Slides: https://telaviv2019.bitcoinedge.org/files/debugging-tools-for-bitcoin-core.pdf

Introduction I am going to talk about debugging Bitcoin. Of course if you want to contribute to Bitcoin there are a lot of conceptual things that you have to understand in order to do that. Most of the talks here today and tomorrow are about that. But actually writing code or fixing stuff, you will also have to learn some things on a practical level.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallet Design Best Practices</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/hardware-wallet-design-best-practices/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/hardware-wallet-design-best-practices/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171322716303036417
Introduction We have 30 minutes. This was a talk by me and Jimmy but Jimmy talked for like 5 hours yesterday so I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking today.
Imagine you want to start working in bitcoin development. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance you will end up using a hardware wallet. In principle, it&amp;rsquo;s not any different from other software development. There&amp;rsquo;s still programming involved, like for firmware. Wallets have certain features and nuances compared to software wallets.</description></item><item><title>Libbitcoin: A practical introduction</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/libbitcoin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/libbitcoin/</guid><description>or: libbitcoin&amp;rsquo;s bx tool: Constructing a raw transaction

Introduction I am going to talk about libbitcoin. It&amp;rsquo;s an alternative implementation of Bitcoin Core. There&amp;rsquo;s a few alternatives out there, like btcd and then bcoin. Libbitcoin is written in C++ and it&amp;rsquo;s the oldest alternative implementation that is out there. I&amp;rsquo;d like to show a few examples of what you can do with libbitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;d like to show how it is designed and give you a sense for its architecture an dalso show some design tradeoffs compared to the original implementation.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Sphinx And Onion Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-sphinx-and-onion-routing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-sphinx-and-onion-routing/</guid><description>Introduction Hi everyone. I am a developer of rust-lightning, it started in 2018 by BlueMatt. I started contributing about a year ago now. It&amp;rsquo;s a full featured, flexible, spec-compliant lightning library. It targets exchanges, wallet vendors, hardware, meshnet devices, and you can join us on Freenode IRC in the #rust-bitcoin channel which is a really nice one.
Privacy matters Privacy matters on the blockchain. This is the reason why lightning is taking so much time.</description></item><item><title>Lightning network topology, its creation and maintenance</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-topology/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-topology/</guid><description>Introduction Alright. Give me a second to test this. Alright. Antoine has taken you through the routing layer. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take you through what the lightning network looks like today. This is the current topology of the network and how this came about, and some approaches for maintaining the network and making the graph look like we want it to look.
Lightning brief overview There&amp;rsquo;s ideally only two transactions involved in any lightning channel, the commitment transaction and the closure transaction.</description></item><item><title>Mining Firmware Security</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/mining-firmware-security/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/mining-firmware-security/</guid><description>slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1apJRD1BwskElWP0Yb1C_tXmGYA_vkx9rjS8VTDW_Z3A/edit?usp=sharing</description></item><item><title>Signet annd its uses for development</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/signet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/signet/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171310731100381184

Introduction I was going to talk about signet yesterday but people had some delay downloading docker images. How many of you have signet right now? How many think you have signet right now? How many downloaded something yesterday? How many docker users? And how many people have compiled it themselves? Okay. I think we have like 10 people. The people that compiled it yourself, I think you&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to do this.</description></item><item><title>Statechains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/statechains/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/statechains/</guid><description>Schnorr signatures, adaptor signatures and statechains

Introduction If you want to know the details of statechains, I recommend checking out my talk from Breaking Bitcoin 2019 Amsterdam. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a quick recap of Schnorr signatures and adaptor signatures and then statechains. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand Schnorr signatures to the point where you&amp;rsquo;re really comfortable with it. A lot of the cool stuff in bitcoin right now is related to or using Schnorr signatures.</description></item><item><title>Acumulator Based Cryptography &amp; UTreexo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/accumulators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/accumulators/</guid><description>https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10-08-utxo-accumulators-and-utreexo/

Introduction Alright guys. Come on in. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of seats, guys. If you&amp;rsquo;re sitting out on the edge, be nice to the other folks and get in the middle. Sitting at the edge is kind of being a dick. You&amp;rsquo;re not letting anyone through. Come on guys, you don&amp;rsquo;t have USB-C yet? You all have powerbanks. Get with the times. Okay, we&amp;rsquo;re getting started.
I have 90 minutes to teach you the rest of my book.</description></item><item><title>Build a Taproot</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/taproot/</guid><description>https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YVOYJGmQ_mY-5_Rs0Cu84AYSI6wCvpfIgoapfgsYP2U/edit

Introduction You&amp;rsquo;re not going to walk out of here as a privacy protocol developer. I am going to mention and talk about some ideas in some protocols that exist. What I find myself is that of really smart people working on a lot of pretty cool stuff that can make privacy easier and better to use. A lot of times, application developers or exchanges aren&amp;rsquo;t even aware of those things and as a result the end result is that people just sometimes use bitcoin in very non-private ways because they&amp;rsquo;re not aware of how to do privacy.</description></item><item><title>Rebroadcast logic in Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/rebroadcasting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/rebroadcasting/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171042478088232960
Introduction Hi, my name is Amiti. Thank you for having me here today. I wanted to talk with you about rebroadcasting logic in Bitcoin Core. For some context, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving it this summer. I wanted to tell you all about it.
What is rebroadcasting? We all know what a broadcast is. It&amp;rsquo;s hwen we send an INV message out to our peers and we let them know about a new transaction.</description></item><item><title>Routing Problems and Solutions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/2019-09-09-carla-kirk-cohen-routing-problems-and-solutions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/2019-09-09-carla-kirk-cohen-routing-problems-and-solutions/</guid><description>Topic: Routing Problems and Solutions
Location: Tel-Aviv 2019
Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about routing in the Lightning Network now. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to touch on how it&amp;rsquo;s currently operating, some issues that you run into when you are routing, and then some potential expansions to the spec which are going to address some of these issues.
We ran through the Lightning Network graph: the nodes of vertices, the channels in this graph of edges.</description></item><item><title>Wallet Architecture in Bitcoin Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/wallet-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/wallet-architecture/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171018684816605185
Introduction Thanks Bryan for talking about HD wallets. I am going to be talking about wallet architecture in Bitcoin Core. Alright. Who am I? I work on Bitcoin Core. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code on Bitcoin Core for about 3 years. Lately I have been working on the wallet. I work for Chaincode Labs which is why I get to work on Bitcoin Core. We are a small research lab in New York.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-routing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-routing/</guid><description>Introduction Good afternoon everyone. My name is Carla. I am one of the chaincode residents this summer. This talk is going to walk through the protocol layer by layer and look at the different components that make up the network. Lightning is an off-chain scaling solution which consists of a p2p network of payment channels. It allows payments to be forwarded by nodes in exchange for fees.
Scaling with payment channels This involves a payment channel.</description></item><item><title>Metadata</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/metadata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/metadata/</guid><description>https://bitcoinedge.org/slack</description></item></channel></rss>
