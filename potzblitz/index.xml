Intro I am going to be talking about towers and a bit about BOLT 13 too. Before jumping into watchtowers and this general idea of watchtowers for the Lightning Network that most of the community knows about I would like to go back one step back to try to narrow down the paradigm that we are going to be talking about.</description></item><item><title>Back the f**k up! - How to secure your Lightning Network node</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/potzblitz/2020-05-03-christian-decker-lightning-backups/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/potzblitz/2020-05-03-christian-decker-lightning-backups/</guid><description>Intro (Jeff Gallas) We’re live. Welcome to the fourth episode of Potzblitz, the weekly Lightning talk. Today we have a very special guest, Christian Decker of Blockstream. They also call him Dr Bitcoin. Our co-host today is Michael Folkson from the London BitDevs meetup. He is doing a bunch of Socratic Seminars and has a deep technical knowledge. He will be the perfect person to speak to Christian and has already prepared a bunch of questions.</description></item></channel></rss>
