Lattice cryptography - from computational complexity to fully homomorphic encryption
Introduction 1 So this first of all thanks for coming back from lunch, it&amp;rsquo;s always an achievement. I want to say that this is a special talk within the workshop here at Simons we have a historical cryptopapers seminars series. We try to revisit historical papers and see what led to them and how they impacted things later.</description></item><item><title>Pairing Cryptography</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/pairing-cryptography/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/pairing-cryptography/</guid><description>Dan Boneh (see also 1)

Okay, so um I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to introduce another speaker in this historical papers series seminar seminar series which is organized by Daniel Wigs and Vanakutanata. Daniel is here but where&amp;rsquo;s..? Okay. All of these talks are being recorded, you can watch some online if you have missed some. It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to introduce Dan Boneh, a professor at Stanford.</description></item><item><title>A Wishlist For Verifiable Computation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/a-wishlist-for-verifiable-computation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/a-wishlist-for-verifiable-computation/</guid><description>A wishlist for verifiable computation: An applied computer science perspective

I want to begin by thanking the organizers, especially the tall guy for allowing me to be here. This talk will be talking about a research area where the goal is deployable systems for verifiable computation for probabilistic proofs like SNARKs etc. The goal of this talk is to motivate the next theoretical steps in this area.</description></item><item><title>Snarks And Their Practical Applications</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/snarks-and-their-practical-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/snarks-and-their-practical-applications/</guid><description>Joint works with:
Eli Ben-Sasson Matthew Green Alessandro Chiesa Ian Miers Christina Garman Madars Virza Daniel Genkin Thank you very much. I would like to thank the organizers for giving this opportunity to learn so much from my peers and colleagues some of which are here. This is a wonderful survey of many of the works in this area. As I was sitting here, I was in real-time adjusting my slides to minimize the overlap.</description></item><item><title>Todo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/todo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/todo/</guid><description> cryptography bootcamp https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre139cwM0pjuxMa_YVzMeCiTf mathematics of modern cryptography https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre10kb0so1PQ3eNz4Q6EBfecT historical papers in cryptography https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre13lX4C_5ZCQKMDOniAn24NP securing computation https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre12ddBkIB8wNC8D1kag5dEr-</description></item><item><title>Zero Knowledge Probabilistic Proof Systems</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/zero-knowledge-probabilistic-proof-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/zero-knowledge-probabilistic-proof-systems/</guid><description>Historical Papers in Cryptography Seminar Series, Simons Institute
She has received several awards, she is a source of incredibly creative ideas, very effective advisor and metor, and I am always inspired when she speaks. So please welcome her.
There is no better place to give this historical talk on zero knowledge than at Berkeley where there are pre-historical origins of zero knowledge. At the same time it&amp;rsquo;s a difficult talk to give, because this is a very distinguished group here, and therefore I changed the talk from one for a broad audience to one that might be of interest to everyone here.</description></item></channel></rss>
