Introduction Buenos Dias San Salvador, I&amp;rsquo;m Bastien. Hopefully my slides are going to come up. Oh yay, perfect. So I&amp;rsquo;m working on the Lightning Protocol Specification and one of its main implementation at Acinq.
I&amp;rsquo;m here to talk to you about privacy. This is a big topic. It&amp;rsquo;s not a black and white thing. There are various degrees of gray when you talk about what your threat model is, who you want to protect against.</description></item><item><title>Onboarding Bitcoin and Lightning Developers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/adopting-bitcoin/2021/onboarding-bitcoin-and-lightning-developers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/adopting-bitcoin/2021/onboarding-bitcoin-and-lightning-developers/</guid><description>Introductions Introducer: 00:00:15

Intro Hi I’m Gloria, I work on Bitcoin Core at Brink. Today I am going to talk a bit about mempool policy and why you cannot always expect your transactions to propagate or your fee bumps to work. What we are doing to try to resolve stuff like that. This talk is for those of you who find the mempool a bit murky or unstable or unpredictable. You are not really sure if it is an interface you are comfortable building an application on top of.</description></item></channel></rss>
