Matt Corallo (MC): Thank you.
Update on LDK AJ: We are going to start with LDK. Where are we at? What is going on?

If we go back in time to version 0.1, all that was stored was the blockchain and I think a marker saying whether that coin was spent or not. I mean that&amp;rsquo;s okay for your first version but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really scale and it&amp;rsquo;s bad performance because every time you want to access a coin you need to read it from disk.

Just to throw out a few numbers there, non-SegWit inputs cost almost 300 bytes, and native SegWit inputs cost slightly more than 100 bytes. There&amp;rsquo;s almost a reduction by two-thirds in fees if you switch from non-SegWit to native SegWit.

Right now in the Lightning Network, if I were to make a payment every single hop along that route, they would know that they&amp;rsquo;re on the same route, because every single HTLC uses the same hash. It&amp;rsquo;s a bad privacy leak. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a much worse privacy leak now that we have multi-path payments, because every single path along your multi-path payment uses the same hash as well.</description></item><item><title>Compact Blocks and Fibre</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-03-12-matt-corallo-compact-blocks-fibre/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-03-12-matt-corallo-compact-blocks-fibre/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Podcast (Episode 6)
