Introduction Alrighty, let&amp;rsquo;s get started. Gather around. Phil could use some company here. Nobody likes the front row. Maybe the benches. So I have a little different format for how I want to do it this week. Usually I cover a broad series of topics that I steal from the New York&amp;rsquo;s meetup list. Going through that, I thought there was something that looked interesting which was the new taproot proposals that were finally posted by Pieter Wuille.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar 5</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2020-01-21-socratic-seminar-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2020-01-21-socratic-seminar-5/</guid><description>https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Bitcoin-Developers/events/267941700/

LSATs So we usually start off with a lightning-based project demo that he has been working on for a few months.
This is not an original idea to me. This was presented by roasbeef, co-founder of Lightning Labs at the Lightning conference last October. I worked on a project that did something similar. When he presented this as a more formalized specification, it made a lot of sense based on what I was working on.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar 4</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-11-19-socratic-seminar-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-11-19-socratic-seminar-4/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1196947713658626048
Wallet standards organization (WSO) Make an economic argument for vendors to join an organization and put in some money or effort to build the organization. The economic argument is that the committed members have some level of funds committed, representing some X number of users, and X billion dollars of custodied funds. This can then be used as a compelling argument to get each organization to join and bootstrap the standards body.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar 3</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-10-14-socratic-seminar-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-10-14-socratic-seminar-3/</guid><description>https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Bitcoin-Developers/events/265295570/

We have sort of done two meetups in this format. The idea here is that in NY there&amp;rsquo;s BitDevs which is one of the oldest meetups. This has been going on for five years. They have a format called socratic where they have a talented guy named J who leads them through some topics and they try to get some discussion going on and pull from expertise in the audience.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar 2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-08-22-socratic-seminar-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-08-22-socratic-seminar-2/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1164710800910692353
Introduction Hello. The idea was to do a more socratic style meetup. This was popularized by Bitdevs NYC and spread to SF. We tried this a few months ago with Jay. The idea is we run through research news, newsletters, podcasters, talk about what happened in the technical bitcoin community. We&amp;rsquo;re going to have different presenters.
Mike Schmidt is going to talk about some optech newsletters that he has been contributing to.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-06-29-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-06-29-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1145019634547978240

Intro So the goal here as Justin said is to get the regtest environment set up. The advantages he mentioned, there is also the advantage that you can mine your own coins at will so you don’t have to mess around with testnet faucets. You can generate blocks as well so you don’t have to wait for six confirmations or whatever or even the ten minutes.</description></item></channel></rss>
