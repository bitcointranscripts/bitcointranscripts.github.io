Rene Pickhardt and Lisa Neigut shared their insights, highlighting Lightning&amp;rsquo;s potential as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and a future payment infrastructure. They emphasized its efficiency for frequent transactions between trusted parties but noted challenges in its current infrastructure, such as the need for continuous online operation and the risk of losing funds if a node is compromised. The panelists discussed the scalability of the network, indicating that while millions could use it self-sovereignly, larger-scale adoption would likely involve centralized service providers. The conversation also touched on the impact of Taproot on privacy and channel efficiency, and the technical intricacies of maintaining state and preventing fraud within the network.</description></item><item><title>Tradeoffs in Permissionless Systems</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/tradeoffs-in-permissionless-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/tradeoffs-in-permissionless-systems/</guid><description>Introduction Hello. I wanted to make a talk about what I work on because I consider it the, well, the area of code that I work in, because I considered it to be one of the most fascinating and definitely the most underrated part of Bitcoin that no one ever talks about. And the reason is I kind of see it as where one of the most important ideological goals of Bitcoin translates into technical challenges, which also happens to be very, very interesting.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin R&amp;D Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/bitcoin-randd-panel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/bitcoin-randd-panel/</guid><description>Ayush: 00:00:07
My name is Ayush Khandelwal. I am a software engineer at Google. I run a tech crypto-focused podcast on the side. And I have some amazing guests with me. So if you want to introduce yourself, what do you work on? And yeah, just get us started.

I am Jeremy Rubin. I am a class of 2016 MIT alumni, so it&amp;rsquo;s good to be back on campus.</description></item><item><title>Long-Term Trust and Analog Computers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/long-term-trust-and-analog-computers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/long-term-trust-and-analog-computers/</guid><description>What I am here to talk to you about are analog computers and long-term trust. And what I mean by long-term trust is how can you have assurance that your Bitcoin secrets, your seed words or your seed phrase or whatever have you, how can you be assured that that is stored correctly, that the data has integrity and so on, and how can you be assured of that for a long time?</description></item></channel></rss>
