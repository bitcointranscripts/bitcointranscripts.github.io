Introduction When people put comments and they are fixed they should mark them as resolved so that we don’t waste time thinking there are lots of outstanding comments and we have to read them again. I think that helps a lot.
I can spend some time doing that.
There are a lot of comments, I’m starting at the bottom to see the things that have maybe not been addressed yet.</description></item><item><title>Lightning specification call (2022-01-31)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2022-01-31-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2022-01-31-specification-call/</guid><description>Name: Lightning specification call

Bitcoin Core funding a transaction without looking at ancestors I have something that I wanted to ask of our implementers who implemented a wallet. It is tangentially related to Lightning especially for anchor outputs. I realized recently that when you ask Bitcoin Core to fund a transaction at a given fee rate it is not going to look at the ancestors and it is not going to take the ancestor’s fee rate into account.</description></item><item><title>Lightning specification call (2022-02-14)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2022-02-14-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2022-02-14-specification-call/</guid><description>Name: Lightning specification call

Organizing a Lightning Core Dev meetup I was talking about organizing a face to face Lightning Core Dev meetup. If I understand correctly there has only been one formal one and that was in 2019 in Australia. There has been two?
Milan, the kickoff. There has only ever been two.</description></item><item><title>Lightning specification call (2022-03-14)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2022-03-14-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2022-03-14-specification-call/</guid><description>Name: Lightning specification call

BOLT 4: Remove legacy format, make var_onion_optin compulsory https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/962
I think eclair and c-lightning have both removed support for legacy payments.
I’ll probably make a PR to add the feature bit or at least flip it to required. The only wallet I can think of that is somewhat more fringe now is Simple Bitcoin Wallet.</description></item></channel></rss>
