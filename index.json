I am going to go over why block size shouldn\u0026amp;rsquo;t be too big.\nHow does bitcoin work? Miners put transactrions into blocks. Users verify that the blocks are valid. If the users don\u0026amp;rsquo;t verify this, then miners can do basically anything. Because the users do this, 51% attacks are limited to reorgs which is undoing transactions.
