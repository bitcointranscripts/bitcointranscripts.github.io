Blockchain database technology in a global context
Alan Murray - Moderator
Lawrence H. Summers
AM: I would like to show a video.
It&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen. You&amp;rsquo;re wasting your time. When the DOJ calls you up and says it&amp;rsquo;s an illegal currency, it&amp;rsquo;s over. You will be put in jail. There will be no non-controlled currency in the world. There is no government that is going to put up with it in the world.</description></item><item><title>Clearing And Settlement For Global Financial Institutions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/clearing-and-settlement-for-global-financial-institutions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/clearing-and-settlement-for-global-financial-institutions/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

Delaware initiative
It&amp;rsquo;s good to see so many friendly audiences in the audience. I am at Pillsbury Wintrhop Shaw Pittman. We are focusing on distinct areas of law as it applies to blockchain tech. We have been in the space as early as 2011 so we were trying to do the land grab. My team has been asked by the State of Delaware to serve as legal ambassadors to the blockchain industry.</description></item><item><title>Future Of Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-blockchains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-blockchains/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

PV: Everyone has been asking me to stir you guys up. We have 25 minutes. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time. Which one of you is building betamax?
BS: Bitcoin and blockchain database technology are complementary. I think last year I was much more bearish on private blockchain database technology.</description></item><item><title>Future Of Regulation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-regulation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-regulation/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

How to get bitcoin
Balaji Srinivasan
My talk is going to be pretty different from the others. I will try to make this relevant to the blockchain database technology attendees. We&amp;rsquo;re going to talk here today what we call the machine web. It&amp;rsquo;s a web where machines earn bitcoin on each HTTP request. Who here knows what an HTTP request? Every time you load a web page, you make a lot of HTTP requests.</description></item><item><title>Internal Approaches Blockchain Database Technology Strategies</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/internal-approaches-blockchain-database-technology-strategies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/internal-approaches-blockchain-database-technology-strategies/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

Why bitcoin still matters
Hutchins, Founder of Silver Lake
I hope in the coming days that the experts will critique me to help me learn more. I hope people from the general community, rather the experts pardon me, what I have an initial hypothesis regarding what will help bitcoin reach its full potential for its extraordinary opportunity that I think it is.
The title of my presentation was &amp;ldquo;Why bitcoin still matters&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
