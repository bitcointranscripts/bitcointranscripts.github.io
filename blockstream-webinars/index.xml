Okay, thanks everyone for coming. I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to go ahead and get started. It&amp;rsquo;s right at 11.02 on my time, so that hopefully more people will show up, but for everyone who&amp;rsquo;s here, I want to make the best use of all of your time. Okay, great. So for those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t really sure what dual funding is, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard people say that word before, but let me give you a kind of a quick overview.</description></item><item><title>Simplicity: Next-Gen Smart Contracting</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2020-04-08-adam-back-simplicity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2020-04-08-adam-back-simplicity/</guid><description>Slides: https://docsend.com/view/svs27jr

Intro I am going to describe Simplicity which we made an announcement recently. It is a next generation script language for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like networks which include Elements and Liquid. It is primarily the work of Russell O’Connor but Andrew Poelstra has been helping also since Fall of last year where we made a previous release.</description></item><item><title>C-Lightning Questions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-09-04-christian-decker-c-lightning-questions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-09-04-christian-decker-c-lightning-questions/</guid><description>c-lightning Q and A session

Introduction Hello everyone. I’m Christian. I’m a software developer at Blockstream and I work on Lightning, both the specification and the implementation. Today we are going to have a shortish webinar on how to get started with Lightning.
Q and A Q - Is it possible to run c-lightning and lnd on the same host in parallel?
A - It absolutely is. We actually do that on a regular basis to test compatibility between the implementations.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started With C-Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-07-31-rusty-russell-getting-started-with-c-lightning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-07-31-rusty-russell-getting-started-with-c-lightning/</guid><description>Getting started with c-lightning

Introduction Hi everyone. We’re actually a couple of minutes early and I think we are going to give a couple of minutes past before we actually start because I think some people will probably be running late particularly with the change in times we had to make after this was announced. While we are waiting it would be interesting to find out a little bit about the attendees’ backgrounds and what they hope to get out of this.</description></item></channel></rss>
