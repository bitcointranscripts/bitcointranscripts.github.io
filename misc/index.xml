Adam Back (adam3us) Epicenter (EC)
Sebastien Couture (SC) Brian Fabian Crain (BC)
BC: Adam Back is here for the second time on this show. Some of you will be familiar that Adam Back is the inventor of proof-of-work or hashcash as it was then. He was one of the few people cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. More recently he has been involved in sidechains and Blockstream where he is a founder.</description></item><item><title>2016 12 14 Whalepool</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/2016-12-14-whalepool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/2016-12-14-whalepool/</guid><description>Whalepool segwit transcript

Introduction Thank you very much for that introduction. Alright, well polished machine right there. Let&amp;rsquo;s try that again. Thank you for that introduction. My talk today is all about this. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be talking about this. If you see me reaching for the red hat, please stop me. Before I begin, I want to apologize in advance: this talk is a summary of things coming up in bitcoin that some people are workin on, which means first I need to apologize to the people whose work I am about to compress into about 85 second segments each, because I am going to gloss over a lot of things.</description></item><item><title>2018 02 02 Andrew Poelstra Bulletproofs</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/2018-02-02-andrew-poelstra-bulletproofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/2018-02-02-andrew-poelstra-bulletproofs/</guid><description>Bulletproofs

Introduction Alright. Thank you for that introduction, Giacamo. I am here to talk about bulletproofs. This is different from proof-of-bullets, which is what fiat currencies use. In bulletproofs, we use a zero-knowledge proof which has nothing to do with consensus at all, but it has a lot of exciting applications. The original motivation to create bulletproofs was for range proofs which are used in confidential transactions.</description></item><item><title>2019 01 05 Unchained Capital Socratic Seminar</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/2019-01-05-unchained-capital-socratic-seminar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/2019-01-05-unchained-capital-socratic-seminar/</guid><description>Unchained Capital Bitcoin Socratic Seminar

Introduction It seems strange to come to a university and put PhD on my slides because in the finance world that&amp;rsquo;s weird. I put it up there.
Okay, so. I work for Fidelity Digital Assets. Just a couple words about this.

Fungibility and privacy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dAdI3Gzodo
First of all I was going to explain what we mean by fungibility before bitcoin and ecash. It&amp;rsquo;s an old legal concept in fact, about paper currency. It&amp;rsquo;s the idea that a one ten dollar note is the same as any other ten dollar note. If you receive a note that was involved in a theft, 10 transactions ago, and the police investigate the theft, they have no right to remove the ten dollar note from your pocket.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Sidechains Unchained Epicenter Adam3Us Gmaxwell</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</guid><description>EB65 – Adam Back &amp;amp; Greg Maxwell: Sidechains Unchained

people:
Sebastien Couture Brian Fabian Crain Adam Back (adam3us) Greg Maxwell (gmaxwell) Brian: We are here today we have Adam Back and Greg Maxwell, to anyone who is following bitcoin and bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s development, you will have probably heard of these two gentlemen. I was fortunate enough that the first time that I went to a bitcoin conference at the beginning of my involvement in this space, it was in Amsterdam 2013 and I somehow randomly ended up having dinner twice with Adam which really was super fascinating talking to him about bitcoin, and so I&amp;rsquo;m really exciting to have them on today, especially since we are going to have a chance to talk about a project we have talked about many times on this show before, with different people, which is sidechains, because sidechains I think that everyone is in agreement that it is one of the more interesting projects in the space, and a lot of people have many questions about it.</description></item><item><title>Cftc Bitcoin</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/cftc-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/cftc-bitcoin/</guid><description>Commodity Futures Trading Commission

And that&amp;rsquo;s a serious problem that we all need to address with a hightened sense of urgency and focus. Let me start with the BitLicense and virtual currencies. These came on our radar screen last year at DFS because like all of the other states we regulate money transmitters like Moneygram and Western Union. We were worried that virtual currency firms were transmitting currency. Our regulatory rules were written before the internet and before virtual currencies.</description></item><item><title>Safecurves Choosing Safe Curves For Elliptic Curve Cryptography 2014</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/safecurves-choosing-safe-curves-for-elliptic-curve-cryptography-2014/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/safecurves-choosing-safe-curves-for-elliptic-curve-cryptography-2014/</guid><description>SafeCurves: Choosing Safe Curves for Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Video intro text There are several different standards covering selection of curves for use in elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). Each of these standards tries to ensure that the elliptic-curve discrete-logarithm problem (ECDLP) is difficult. ECDLP is the problem of finding an ECC user&amp;rsquo;s secret key, given the user&amp;rsquo;s public key.</description></item><item><title>Scalingbitcoin</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/scalingbitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/misc/scalingbitcoin/</guid><description>[[!map pages=&amp;ldquo;transcripts/scalingbitcoin/* and ! transcripts/scalingbitcoin/*/*&amp;quot;]]</description></item></channel></rss>
