Fungibility and privacy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dAdI3Gzodo
First of all I was going to explain what we mean by fungibility before bitcoin and ecash. It&amp;rsquo;s an old legal concept in fact, about paper currency. It&amp;rsquo;s the idea that a one ten dollar note is the same as any other ten dollar note. If you receive a note that was involved in a theft, 10 transactions ago, and the police investigate the theft, they have no right to remove the ten dollar note from your pocket.</description></item><item><title>Adam3Us Bitcoin - Scaling Tradeoffs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/adam3us-bitcoin-scaling-tradeoffs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/adam3us-bitcoin-scaling-tradeoffs/</guid><description>Bitcoin scaling tradeoffs with Adam Back (adam3us) at Paralelni Polis

Now when I say &amp;ldquo;the wallet&amp;rdquo;, a lot of people think of the GUI. That&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.

Introduction Alright. Thank you for that introduction, Giacamo. I am here to talk about bulletproofs. This is different from proof-of-bullets, which is what fiat currencies use. In bulletproofs, we use a zero-knowledge proof which has nothing to do with consensus at all, but it has a lot of exciting applications. The original motivation to create bulletproofs was for range proofs which are used in confidential transactions.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Optech - Schnorr and Taproot workshop (2019-09-27)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2019-09-27-schnorr-taproot-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2019-09-27-schnorr-taproot-workshop/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs, NYC

Why Schnorr and why taproot? Who here already feels comfortbale with Schnorr/Taproot? This is a proposed consensus change to bitcoin. When we talk about consensus changes, we often talk about tradeoffs and compromises. It would be irresponsible to say taproot has no downsides, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to mention it&amp;rsquo;s a clear win for bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Sidechains - Unchained Epicenter Adam3Us, Gmaxwell (2015-02-03)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</guid><description>EB65 – Adam Back &amp;amp; Greg Maxwell: Sidechains Unchained

I was fortunate enough that the first time that I went to a bitcoin conference at the beginning of my involvement in this space, it was in Amsterdam 2013 and I somehow randomly ended up having dinner twice with Adam which really was super fascinating talking to him about bitcoin, and so I&amp;rsquo;m really exciting to have them on today, especially since we are going to have a chance to talk about a project we have talked about many times on this show before, with different people, which is sidechains, because sidechains I think that everyone is in agreement that it is one of the more interesting projects in the space, and a lot of people have many questions about it.</description></item><item><title>CFTC Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/cftc-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/cftc-bitcoin/</guid><description>Commodity Futures Trading Commission

And that&amp;rsquo;s a serious problem that we all need to address with a hightened sense of urgency and focus. Let me start with the BitLicense and virtual currencies. These came on our radar screen last year at DFS because like all of the other states we regulate money transmitters like Moneygram and Western Union. We were worried that virtual currency firms were transmitting currency. Our regulatory rules were written before the internet and before virtual currencies.</description></item><item><title>Rusty Russell Future Bitcoin Tech Directions (2018-01-24)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/</guid><description>Future technological directions in bitcoin: An unreliable guide

Video intro text There are several different standards covering selection of curves for use in elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). Each of these standards tries to ensure that the elliptic-curve discrete-logarithm problem (ECDLP) is difficult. ECDLP is the problem of finding an ECC user&amp;rsquo;s secret key, given the user&amp;rsquo;s public key.</description></item><item><title>Unchained Capital Socratic Seminar (2019-01-05)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2019-01-05-unchained-capital-socratic-seminar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2019-01-05-unchained-capital-socratic-seminar/</guid><description>Unchained Capital Bitcoin Socratic Seminar
