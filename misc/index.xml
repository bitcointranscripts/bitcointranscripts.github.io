Transcript completed by: Michael Folkson
Intro Hi everyone. Thanks for coming to my talk. As I was introduced I’m Jonathan Metzman. I’m here to talk about how you can get more bugs with coverage guided fuzzing by adding structure awareness to your fuzzers.
Unstructured Fuzzing = Magic I first got into fuzzing while I was in college through AFL. I started using AFL to find bugs in my school projects and later I moved onto finding bugs in real software like sqlite with AFL.</description></item><item><title>On-Chain Defense in Depth</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2019-02-09-mcelrath-on-chain-defense-in-depth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2019-02-09-mcelrath-on-chain-defense-in-depth/</guid><description>On-chain defense in depth (UCL CBT seminar)

Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m Jim from the protocol team at Coinbase. We work on open source stuff in the crypto space. We just contribute to projects like Bitcoin core. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m talking about this is I&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing on and off to one of the major lightning implementations lnd for the past eight months or so.

Introduction Alright. Thank you for that introduction, Giacamo. I am here to talk about bulletproofs. This is different from proof-of-bullets, which is what fiat currencies use. In bulletproofs, we use a zero-knowledge proof which has nothing to do with consensus at all, but it has a lot of exciting applications. The original motivation to create bulletproofs was for range proofs which are used in confidential transactions.</description></item><item><title>Future Bitcoin Tech Directions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/</guid><description>Future technological directions in bitcoin: An unreliable guide

Introduction Thank you very much for that introduction. Alright, well polished machine right there. Let&amp;rsquo;s try that again. Thank you for that introduction. My talk today is all about this. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be talking about this. If you see me reaching for the red hat, please stop me. Before I begin, I want to apologize in advance: this talk is a summary of things coming up in bitcoin that some people are workin on, which means first I need to apologize to the people whose work I am about to compress into about 85 second segments each, because I am going to gloss over a lot of things.</description></item><item><title>The Great Debate Whalepool</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2016-12-14-whalepool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2016-12-14-whalepool/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/809174512105295872

Intro fluff And now I would like to introduce you to a great guest from the U.K. or Malta, Adam Back. Adam is long-time professional cryptologist and also he&amp;rsquo;s a Bitcoin expert. He&amp;rsquo;s the inventor of hashcash, which was used for example by Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Why Bitcoin Needs A Measured Approach To Scaling</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2015-09-07-epicenter-bitcoin-adam3us-scalability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2015-09-07-epicenter-bitcoin-adam3us-scalability/</guid><description>BC: Adam Back is here for the second time on this show. Some of you will be familiar that Adam Back is the inventor of proof-of-work or hashcash as it was then. He was one of the few people cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. More recently he has been involved in sidechains and Blockstream where he is a founder. He has been vocal in the bitcoin block size debate and how it should be done or how it should be done.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Sidechains - Unchained Epicenter</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</guid><description>EB65 – Adam Back &amp;amp; Greg Maxwell: Sidechains Unchained
people:
Sebastien Couture Brian Fabian Crain Adam Back (adam3us) Greg Maxwell (gmaxwell) Brian: We are here today we have Adam Back and Greg Maxwell, to anyone who is following bitcoin and bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s development, you will have probably heard of these two gentlemen. I was fortunate enough that the first time that I went to a bitcoin conference at the beginning of my involvement in this space, it was in Amsterdam 2013 and I somehow randomly ended up having dinner twice with Adam which really was super fascinating talking to him about bitcoin, and so I&amp;rsquo;m really exciting to have them on today, especially since we are going to have a chance to talk about a project we have talked about many times on this show before, with different people, which is sidechains, because sidechains I think that everyone is in agreement that it is one of the more interesting projects in the space, and a lot of people have many questions about it.</description></item><item><title>NY DFS Bitlicense Lawsky Update</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/nydfs-bitlicense-lawsky-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/nydfs-bitlicense-lawsky-update/</guid><description>NY DFS BitLicense update 2014-12-18

And that&amp;rsquo;s a serious problem that we all need to address with a hightened sense of urgency and focus. Let me start with the BitLicense and virtual currencies. These came on our radar screen last year at DFS because like all of the other states we regulate money transmitters like Moneygram and Western Union. We were worried that virtual currency firms were transmitting currency. Our regulatory rules were written before the internet and before virtual currencies.</description></item><item><title>Fungibility and Privacy</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-adam3us-fungibility-privacy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-adam3us-fungibility-privacy/</guid><description>First of all I was going to explain what we mean by fungibility before bitcoin and ecash. It&amp;rsquo;s an old legal concept in fact, about paper currency. It&amp;rsquo;s the idea that a one ten dollar note is the same as any other ten dollar note. If you receive a note that was involved in a theft, 10 transactions ago, and the police investigate the theft, they have no right to remove the ten dollar note from your pocket.</description></item><item><title>CFTC Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/cftc-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/cftc-bitcoin/</guid><description>Commodity Futures Trading Commission

Video intro text There are several different standards covering selection of curves for use in elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). Each of these standards tries to ensure that the elliptic-curve discrete-logarithm problem (ECDLP) is difficult. ECDLP is the problem of finding an ECC user&amp;rsquo;s secret key, given the user&amp;rsquo;s public key.
Unfortunately, there is a gap between ECDLP difficulty and ECC security.</description></item></channel></rss>
