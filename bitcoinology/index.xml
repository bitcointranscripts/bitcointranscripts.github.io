So if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Lightning wallet installed, please do so. I recommend my company&amp;rsquo;s wallet, Zebedee. So if you just type in Zebedee on my t-shirt into the Google Play or App Store, you should be able to download it.</description></item><item><title>How to Design Schnorr Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/how-to-design-schnorr-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/how-to-design-schnorr-signatures/</guid><description>Passwords So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk to you today about passwords and about the problem with passwords and how we might be able to solve it, right? So we&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with using passwords on the internet and we&amp;rsquo;re all sort of sometimes annoyed about it. Maybe you use a password manager, maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t, but you have this problem, I think we all understand this problem that it&amp;rsquo;s not just about you losing the password, but it&amp;rsquo;s also about keeping it secret, right?</description></item><item><title>Cool Lightning Network Developments</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/2022-01-26-igor-korsakov-cool-ln-developments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/2022-01-26-igor-korsakov-cool-ln-developments/</guid><description>Synonym Igor Synonym is a company that John Carvalho started and he is trying to put Web3 inside of Bitcoin. But what it consists of? They&amp;rsquo;re using several things like identities and people hosting their own data.
AOPP For identity, the first thing I want to mention is Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP). This is the field that we added in BlueWallet some months ago. I think it was a Switzerland exchange that wanted this, so they sent us a pull request and we merged it (PR#2915, PR#4431).</description></item><item><title>What is Lightning Network?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/what-is-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/what-is-lightning-network/</guid><description>Introduction Hello everyone. We&amp;rsquo;re going to sort of soft start now, and this is a new meetup group we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to call Bitcoinology. It&amp;rsquo;s a whimsical name. It&amp;rsquo;s really intended to convey the idea that we want to discuss Bitcoin not in a super developer technical code way, but we do want to discuss it—how it&amp;rsquo;s used, even what the history and culture of it are, and what are the interesting things as a user and as a sort of Bitcoin person you can learn.</description></item></channel></rss>
