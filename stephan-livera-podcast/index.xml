Craig :
Great, Stephan, it’s really good to be back.
Stephan :
Yeah, there’s been so many updates going on with Sparrow Wallet and I thought it’d be great to have you back to chat about the space. Whether it’s multisignature or privacy or import and export of transactions, I think there’s lots of things to add. So, yeah, I’m just curious, as you look at the space now, what are some of the big things on your mind, just kind of more broadly?</description></item><item><title>What Bitcoin Specialises in</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2023-02-23-matt-corallo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2023-02-23-matt-corallo/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/461/

Casey, welcome to the show.
Casey Rodarmor – 00:03:18:
Thank you very much. It’s a real pleasure. I am a long-time listener of the pod. It’s on my short list of Bitcoin podcasts. So it’s really surreal. You’ve been whispering into my ear as I go to the gym and I do whatever for a long time now. So it’s very surreal to actually be talking to you in person or virtually.</description></item><item><title>SLP455 Anant Tapadia - Single Sig or Multi Sig?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/slp455-anant-tapadia-single-sig-or-multi-sig/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/slp455-anant-tapadia-single-sig-or-multi-sig/</guid><description>Stephan 00:00:00:

Hey Stephan, thanks for having me again.
Stephan 00:02:40:
So there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on. I think the conversation around learning to self custody is always an important one. It&amp;rsquo;s always one that&amp;rsquo;s very fresh on my mind as well. And so we&amp;rsquo;re seeing a lot of discussion. And I think recently, of course, there was the news about Luke Dash-jr losing his coins, I think, I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how many, but probably something in the range of 200 bitcoins, so a serious amount of coin.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Miniscript and what it enables</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2023-01-23-antoine-poinsot-and-salvatore-ingala/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2023-01-23-antoine-poinsot-and-salvatore-ingala/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/452/

So obviously the main topic here is going to be around what’s going on with Wasabi Wallet and the blacklisting, but if you wanted to just give us your thoughts on how we got to this situation, or maybe just provide a bit of an overview about what’s going on for listeners who aren’t familiar and then we can discuss the various issues.</description></item><item><title>Pickhardt Payments &amp; Zero Base Fee for Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2022-03-27-rene-pickhardt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2022-03-27-rene-pickhardt/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/361/

Seedsigner:
So glad to be here. Thank you for having me.
Stephan Livera:
So just for listeners, Seedsigner is operating under a pseudonym, so I’m just going to be calling him seed or SeedSigner. So seed, can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how this project came about? What was the inspiration?
Seedsigner:
So it’s actually a full circle kind of journey to be talking with you today because my journey with SeedSigner started probably mid to late last year with an episode that you did with Michael Flaxman on his 10x, Bitcoin security guide.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Offers / BOLT12 -The next big thing in Lightning?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-08-09-rusty-russell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-08-09-rusty-russell/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/298/
