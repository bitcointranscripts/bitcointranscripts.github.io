Introduction First of all welcome to the debugging Bitcoin Core workshop. Everything I know more or less about using a debugger to learn from Bitcoin Core and to fix problems in Bitcoin Core. I didn’t go with traditional slides because I want to teach you how to use this tool, the debugger, in the context of Bitcoin Core.</description></item><item><title>Miniscript</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/</guid><description>Advancing Bitcoin workshop

Transcript of London Bitcoin Devs Miniscript presentation: https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-04-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/
Part 1 So what we’re going to do, there is a couple of things. We are going to go through the Miniscript website and learn about how Miniscript is constructed, how the type system works, some of the anti-malleability rules. Then we’re going to go to a repo that I created last night, a Git repo with some example programs.</description></item><item><title>Signet Workshop</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-kalle-alm-signet-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-kalle-alm-signet-workshop/</guid><description>Topic: Signet Workshop

Intro Hi everyone. Some of you were at my Bitcoin dev presentation about Miniscript a couple of days where I managed to spend over 2 hours giving a presentation about this. I think I got this one down to 20 minutes but no promises. I will keep an eye on the clock.
