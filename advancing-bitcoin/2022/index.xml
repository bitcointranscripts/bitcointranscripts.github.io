And this is a bit of a difficult thing for people to understand who don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the space. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to just be diving into exactly why it&amp;rsquo;s a mission for us to have these static invoices, and then just outlining the three various proposals LNURL, Offers and AMP that people have been discussing.</description></item><item><title>Taproot multisig</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-jimmy-song-taproot-multisig/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-jimmy-song-taproot-multisig/</guid><description>Slides: https://jimmysong.github.io/taproot-multisig

Intro Ok, so good morning. So earlier this week there was the State of the Union Address so I thought I’d make a bad joke first up. This talk is going to be the “State of the Taproot Address”. I promise all the bad jokes that I make in this presentation will all be Drake gifs, there will be no other jokes involved.</description></item></channel></rss>
