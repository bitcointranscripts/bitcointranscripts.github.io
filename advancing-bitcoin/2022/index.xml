Intro Jeff Gallas: Next up is Christian Decker. He is a Lightning developer at Blockstream. He has got a very simple title. It is Security, Simplicity and DevOps: the trade-offs between a Lightning PPAS and running your own node. That is already half of the talk.
Christian Decker: Thank you very much, I’m Chris and for once I am not going to shill eltoo, I promise.</description></item><item><title>Miniscript</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-sanket-kanjalkar-miniscript/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-sanket-kanjalkar-miniscript/</guid><description>Topic: Miniscript: Composable, Analyzable and Smarter Bitcoin Script

Intro (Jeff Gallas) The next speaker is Jimmy Song who doesn’t really need an introduction but in any case, he has been, which is important for this conference, running the Programming Blockchain workshops for 5 years now. Leon is one of his alumni so there is a direct connection to this conference. He has also just released a new book which is a bit more political than technical, it is called “Bitcoin and the American Dream”.</description></item><item><title>Taproot on hardware wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-stepan-snigirev-taproot-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-stepan-snigirev-taproot-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>Intro (Jeff Gallas) I’m very happy to announce our first speaker for today.

Intro Ok, so good morning. So earlier this week there was the State of the Union Address so I thought I’d make a bad joke first up. This talk is going to be the “State of the Taproot Address”. I promise all the bad jokes that I make in this presentation will all be Drake gifs, there will be no other jokes involved.</description></item></channel></rss>
