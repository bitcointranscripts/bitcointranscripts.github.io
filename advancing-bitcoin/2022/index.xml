Intro Ok, so good morning. So earlier this week there was the State of the Union Address so I thought I’d make a bad joke first up. This talk is going to be the “State of the Taproot Address”. I promise all the bad jokes that I make in this presentation will all be Drake gifs, there will be no other jokes involved.</description></item><item><title>Sanket Kanjalkar - Miniscript (2022-03-03)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-sanket-kanjalkar-miniscript/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-sanket-kanjalkar-miniscript/</guid><description>Name: Sanket Kanjalkar
