We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about every single block size proposal. This is going to be the least technical presentation at the conference. I am not going to go into the proposals htemselves. Changing the block size itself is pretty simple. You change a constant. It&amp;rsquo;s more a discussion of algorithms, roll-out, etc.
What are some of the high level concerns with block size?</description>

Bitcoin load spike simulation
Our goal for this project, our rationale of what we&amp;rsquo;re interesting is when many transactions arrive in a short period of time. This could be because of denial of service attacks where few entities are creating a large number of transactions, or many people wanting to create transactions, like a shopping spree. We wanted to answer two questions, how does the temporary spike in transaction rate affect confirmation delay distribution?</description>

      <description>Blockchain design patterns: Layers and scaling approaches
Andrew Poelstra, David Vorick
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171400374336536576
Introduction Alright. Are we ready to get going? Thumbs up? Alright. Cool. I am Andrew and this is David. We&amp;rsquo;re here to talk about blockchain design patterns: layers and scaling approaches. This will be a tour of a bunch of different scaling approaches in bitcoin in particular but it&amp;rsquo;s probably applicable to other blockchains out there. Our talk is in 3 parts.</description>

 Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about some recent advances in block propagation and why this stuff is important. I am going to talk about how the original bitcoin p2p protocol works, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way for the most part anymore.</description>

Introduction Fun fact: I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone knows this fact, but antpool is a miner and antpool is not mining replace-by-fee transactions. What I mean by that is that if you do a replace-by-fee transaction, they will ignore the second high fee transaction. There are cases where transactions are RBF-bumped to increase the fee to make it mined faster, so you RBF bump it, and then you have people spending the unconfirmed RBF version and then have a chain of transactions but then the original transaction is mined and not the other chained transactions.</description>

      <description>Optimizing fee estimation via the mempool state
Karl-Johan Alm (DG Lab)
I am a Bitcoin Core developer and I work at DG Lab. Today I would like to talk about fees. There&amp;rsquo;s this weird gap between&amp;ndash; there are two things going on. People complain about high fees. But people are confused about why Bitcoin Core is giving high fees but if you set fees manually you can get a much lower fee and get a transaction mined pretty fast.</description>

Topic: Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network and Mempool
Location: Bitcoin Edge Dev++ 2017 - Stanford University

Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network John: So far today, we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about transactions and blocks and the blockchain. Those are the fundamental building blocks of Bitcoin. Those are the data structures that we use. On a more practical level, how does a Bitcoin network actually function? How do we transmit these transactions and blocks around?</description>

Amiti Uttarwar (amizi)
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171042478088232960
Introduction Hi, my name is Amiti. Thank you for having me here today. I wanted to talk with you about rebroadcasting logic in Bitcoin Core. For some context, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving it this summer. I wanted to tell you all about it.
What is rebroadcasting? We all know what a broadcast is. It&amp;rsquo;s hwen we send an INV message out to our peers and we let them know about a new transaction.</description>
