post-schnorr lightning transactions https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/001031.html
An adaptor signature.. if you have different generators, then the two secrets to reveal, you just give someone both of them, plus a proof of a discrete log, and then you say learn the secret to one that gets the reveal to be the same.</description>

      <description>Five insights into the defense of bitcoin
Warren Togami
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137389045355614208
Introduction Today I work at Blockstream but I have a long long history working in open-source software first with the Linux operating system as an advocate then working on the operating system itself. This has led me to a few insights on the defense of bitcoin that has little to do with software but it needs a talk thrown together very quickly for today.</description>

      <description>How to mine bitcoin profitability
Minting money with megawatts
Thank you for the introduction. We thought bitcoin was really a good idea for an unstable and inefficient financial world. I am going to dive and talk about this presentation which is how to mine bitcoin profitably. This is a short talk, it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be a short talk, so let&amp;rsquo;s get straight to the crux of the matter.
Bitcoin mining is the lowest part of the transaction stack.</description>

      <description>Designing lightning wallets for the bitcoin user
Building on Bitcoin 2018
Good morning everyone. Thank you for being here. Thank you to the organizers for this event. My talk is about designing lightning wallets for bitcoin users. I am talking about UX. But really, UX is a lot more than what wallets look like. It&amp;rsquo;s from bip39 and making backups much easier, to anything you cna imagine, to make it easier for bitcoin to use bitcoin.</description>

Merkleized abstract syntax trees (MAST) https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-September/014932.html
I am going to talk about the scheme I posted to the mailing list yesterday which is to implement MAST (merkleized abstract syntax trees) in bitcoin in a minimally invasive way as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s broken into two major consensus features that together gives us MAST. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the last BIP.
This is tail-call evaluation. Can we generalize P2SH to give us more general capabilities, than just a single redeem script.</description>

      <description>10x the number of core devs
Objectives:
 10x would only be like &amp;lt;1000 bitcoin developers 7000 fedora developers how do we grow developers?   how many tor developers? how many linux developers?
poaching from each other is not cool
There&amp;rsquo;s not enough people with the necessary skills. There&amp;rsquo;s no clear way to train new people. Apprenticeship works, but it scales very very poorly. It&amp;rsquo;s better than a static fixed number of developers.</description>

Intro Can everyone hear me fine through this microphone? Anyone who can&amp;rsquo;t hear me please raise your hand. Oh wait. All good now? Tonight I will be speaking on a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on on and off for the past year or so, which is the question of what kind of addresses we will be using in Bitcoin in the future.</description>

Demo My project is to create a user interface for lightning that might appeal to a different crowd than ours. We’re kind of used to Linux, open source, free software so being in a proprietary environment like Excel is unfamiliar territory for us. And yet I think that there is a large demographic of people who are interested in Bitcoin who work in the business world where they use Excel day to day.</description>

Hello. This is joint work with Aviv Zohar and I have just moved. And Ron Lavi. And I am going to be talking about tehcniques from&amp;hellip; auction theory.. to rethink how fees in bitcoin are done.

Introduction I am going to talk a little bit about signet. Does anyone not know what signet is? The idea is to have a signature of the block or the previous block. The idea is that testnet is horribly broken for testing things, especially testing things for long-term. You have large reorgs on testnet. What about testnet with a less broken difficulty adjustment? Testnet is for miner testing really.</description>

I can give a summary, but there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk already and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to focus on. What would sipa like us to review in particular about it? What design decisions do you feel least confident about?</description>
