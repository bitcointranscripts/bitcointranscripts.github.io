Intro Good morning from the last day of presentations. I’m Chris still. Today I will be talking to you about c-lightning, how to develop on it, how to extend it, adapt it to your needs and how to customize it so it fits into whatever you are trying to do. Not whatever we thought you might want to do.</description>

LC: Can everyone hear me now? Alright, alright.
WO: It&amp;rsquo;s getting some good usage. A lot of those are businesses. Definitely it&amp;rsquo;s in the early stage. Elizabeth talked about this. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things that are mostly for fun, it&amp;rsquo;s not really at ecommerce yet.
LC: That&amp;rsquo;s for lnd?
WO: Sure, and I think Lisa can talk about c-lightning.</description>

Getting started with c-lightning

Introduction Hi everyone. We’re actually a couple of minutes early and I think we are going to give a couple of minutes past before we actually start because I think some people will probably be running late particularly with the change in times we had to make after this was announced. While we are waiting it would be interesting to find out a little bit about the attendees’ backgrounds and what they hope to get out of this.</description>

Intro Ok I have top running. We have a plan and we’re going to start from zero. We’re going to clone c-lightning, we’re going to compile it, we’re going to set up a test node. I’m assuming Bitcoin is already installed. We’re going to talk a little about configuring it and stuff like that. All this stuff is useful to see somebody else do.</description>

How Rusty got into Lightning Max Hillebrand (MH): So Rusty, I am very happy that you joined me for this conversation today. You have been a pioneer in Lightning Network. To start off this conversation I am curious, 6 years ago before you got into the Lightning Network what was your understanding of Bitcoin back then and where did you see some of the big problems that needed to be solved at that point?</description>

Intro I am going to be talking about towers and a bit about BOLT 13 too. Before jumping into watchtowers and this general idea of watchtowers for the Lightning Network that most of the community knows about I would like to go back one step back to try to narrow down the paradigm that we are going to be talking about.</description>

      <description>Taxonomy of lightning nodes
Lisa Neigut
Introduction Hello. I work at Blockstream on c-lightning. I am here today to talk to you about a taxonomy of nodes about who&amp;rsquo;s who on the lightning network. I wnat ot go through the tools that have been built, looking through the perspectives of what different nodes are trying to accomplish.
LN map There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of nodes on the network. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some stats.</description>
