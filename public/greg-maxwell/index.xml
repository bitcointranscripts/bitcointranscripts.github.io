The blueberry muffins are a lie. But instead I got some other things to present about. My name is Greg Maxwell. I am one of the committers to Bitcoin Core. I am one of the five people with commit access. I have been working on Bitcoin since 2011. Came into Bitcoin through assorted paths as has everyone else.</description>

Introduction Thank you.
So as mentioned, I am going to be talking about confidential transactions today. And I look at confidential transactions as a building block fundamental piece of technology, it&amp;rsquo;s not like altcoin or something like that. It&amp;rsquo;s not a turnkey system, it&amp;rsquo;s some fundamental tech, and there are many different ways to use it and deploy it.
My interest in this technology is primarily driven by bitcoin, but the technology here could be applied to many other things, including things outside of the cryptocurrency space.</description>

Introduction Alright let&amp;rsquo;s get started. There are a lot of new faces in the room. I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s an increase in excitement around bitcoin right now. That&amp;rsquo;s great. For those of you who are new to this space, I am going to be talking about some technical details here, so you&amp;rsquo;ll get to drink from the firehose.</description>

So uh I am really excited to announce or introduce our next speaker, Greg Maxwell. Greg, well, there are people who talk and there&amp;rsquo;s people who do, and Greg is definitely a doer. He is definitely one of the most accomplished if not most helpful, one of the most active people, not just in terms of commits that we see, but also things we don&amp;rsquo;t see, like input regarding bugs and to other developers and being a great voice in this industry.</description>

Can GitHub censor Bitcoin Core? The event isn&amp;rsquo;t news to Bitcoin developers either, github has done this a number of times before&amp;ndash; even taking Mozilla offline as a result of an obviously spurious DMCA complaint.
 Every developer that has the repository cloned has the full history.
 Not just the developers, thousands of users who build from git checkouts have the complete source code history too.</description>

Bitcoin Core testing I believe slower would potentially result in less testing and not likely result in more at this point.
If we had an issue that newly introduced features were turning out to frequently have serious bugs that are discovered shortly after shipping there might be a case that it would improve the situation to delay improvements more before putting them into critical operation&amp;hellip; but I think we&amp;rsquo;ve been relatively free of such issues.</description>

What is stopping the OP_CHECKMULTISIG extra pop bug from being fixed? I think it is probably wrong to describe it as a bug. I think it was intended to indicate which signatures were present to fix the otherwise terrible performance of CHECKMULTISIG.
Regardless, there is no real point to fixing it: Any &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; would require that all software using CHECKMULTISIG get an incompatible change (as part of a highly disruptive hard fork).</description>

Why do hardware wallets not support altcoins? They&amp;rsquo;re an enormous distraction and hazard to software development. It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough to correctly and safely write software to support one system. Every minute spent creating and testing the software for some alternative is a minute taken away from supporting Bitcoin.
I can say first hand that my efforts to review hardware wallet code against possible vulnerabilities have been actively thwarted by hardware wallet codebases being crapped up with support for altcoins.</description>

Is Liquid censorship resistant? Liquid isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly censorship resistant. If someone tells you it is they&amp;rsquo;re confused.
Back when I worked at Blockstream there was thought in the design to mitigate some of the risks: make transactions difficult to identify, even the peg outs use a ring signature to authorize them, and Blockstream should have no ability to change the software in use (instead, they&amp;rsquo;d have to convince each of the functionaries to run replacement software if they wanted it deployed&amp;ndash; and the software is open source).</description>

Risks of multiple implementations They would create more risk. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is any reason to doubt that this is an objective fact which has been borne out by the history.
First, failures in software are not independent. For example, when BU nodes were crashing due to xthin bugs, classic were also vulnerable to effectively the same bug even though their code was different and some triggers that would crash one wouldn&amp;rsquo;t crash the other.</description>

Is PGP replaceable with Bitcoin public key infrastructure? This is true in the same sense that PGP can also be replaced with some fancy functions on a school kids graphing calculator.
Yes you can construct some half-assed imitation of pgp using stuff from Bitcoin, but you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.
If all you really want is some file signing thing without any key certification or encryption, I suggest looking into openbsd&amp;rsquo;s signify.</description>

Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow? Taproot has been discussed for 2.5 years already and by the time it would activate it will certainly at this point be over three years.
The bulk of the Taproot proposal, other than Taproot itself and specific encoding details, is significantly older too.</description>

Why can’t hash power be used for something useful? There is a general game theory reason why this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out:
Imagine that you are considering attempting to reorder the chain to undo a transaction. You could decide to not attempt the attack in which case your cost is just the payment you made, or you could attempt the attack in which case the cost is the energy you put into the plus the cost of the payment times your odds of failure.</description>

Yubikey Security  By this logic, a yubikey would also be a great targeting vector.
 They would be, and if US intelligence services have not compromised yubis or at least have a perfect targeted substitution solutions for them then they should all be fired for gross incompetence and mismanagement of their funding.
Likewise, if parties which things of significant value to secure who might be targeted by state level attackers are securing those things with just yubs instead of using yubis as a second factor in an otherwise secure setup then those parties ought to be fired too.</description>
