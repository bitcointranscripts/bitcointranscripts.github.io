https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137008648620838912
Why assumeutxo assumeutxo is a spiritual continuation of assumevalid. Why do we want to do this in the first place? At the moment, it takes hours and days to do initial block download. Various projects in the community have been implementing meassures to speed this up. Casa I think bundles datadir with their nodes. Other projects like btcpay have various ways of bundling this up and signing things with gpg keys and these solutions are not quite half-baked but they are probably not desirable either.</description>

Bellare-Neven It&amp;rsquo;s been published, it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a decade, and it&amp;rsquo;s widely cited. In Bellare-Neven, it&amp;rsquo;s itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a multi-signature scheme which means multiple pubkeys and one message. You should treat the individual authorizations to spend inputs, as individual messages. What we need is an interactive aggregate signature scheme. Bellare-Neven&amp;rsquo;s paper suggests a trivial way of building an aggregate signature scheme out of a multisig scheme where interactively everyone signs everyone&amp;rsquo;s message.</description>

Bitcoin Optech https://bitcoinops.org/
Bitcoin Optech is trying to encourage bitcoin businesses to adopt better scaling techniques and technologies, things like batching, segwit, down the line maybe Schnorr signatures, aggregatable signatures, maybe lightning. Right now we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on things that businesses could be doing right now. Exchanges could be batching, and some aren&amp;rsquo;t. We&amp;rsquo;re talking to those companies and listening to their concerns and what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and just trying to nudge them in the right direction.</description>

Introduction I wanted to talk about the code review process for Bitcoin Core. I have done no code reviews, but following along the project for the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that this is a pain point for the project and I think most developers would love to see it improved. I&amp;rsquo;d like to help out in some way to help infuse some energy to help with code reviews.</description>

An adaptor signature.. if you have different generators, then the two secrets to reveal, you just give someone both of them, plus a proof of a discrete log, and then you say learn the secret to one that gets the reveal to be the same.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I need to motivate this problem. I presented a work in progress session at Scaling. The cost of relaying transactions or announcing a transaction in a network&amp;ndash; how many announcements do you have? Every link has an announcement in either direction right now, and then there&amp;rsquo;s the number of nodes multiplied by the number of connections per node.</description>

The instant transaction time.. you know I walk up to a cash register, I put my phone there, and in a second or two the transaction is confirmed and I walk away with my coffee. Anything beyond that, 10 minutes versus 1 minute doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. So the problem you want to solve is how do we get instant confirmation.. there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of ideas about this, like a trusted third party that promises to not double spend, have some coins locked up in a multisig wallet like Green Address.</description>

Introduction There&amp;rsquo;s not much new to talk about. Unclear about CODESEPARATOR. You want to make it a consensus rule that transactions can&amp;rsquo;t be larger than 100 kb. No reactions to that? Alright. Fine, we&amp;rsquo;re doing it. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it. Does everyone know what this proposal is?
Validation time for any block&amp;ndash; we were lazy about fixing this. Segwit was a first step to fixing this, by giving people a way to do this in a more efficient way.</description>

https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136924010955104257
How much should Bitcoin Core do, and how much should other libraries do? Andrew Chow wrote the wonderful HWI tool. Right now we have a pull request to support external signers. The HWI script can talk to most major hardware wallets because it has all the drivers built in now, and it can get keys from it, and sign arbitrary transactions. That&amp;rsquo;s roughly what it does. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of manual, though.</description>

Jeremy Allaire, Sean Neville
We are excited to be here and sponsoring this event. We have backgrounds in working on developer tools that goes back to the early days of something.
How do we mature the development of Bitcoin Core itself? One of the things that is useful is suss out the key components of it. In a standard you have a spec, it could be a whitepaper, and then you have a reference implementation, and then a test suite that enforces interoperability.</description>

How do the maintainers think or feel everything is going? Are there any frustrations? Could contributors help eliminate these frustrations? That&amp;rsquo;s all I have.
It would be good to have better oversight or overview about who is working in what direction, to be more efficient. Sometimes I have seen people working on the same thing, and both make a similar pull request with a lot of overlap.</description>

Monday night presentation: http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-09-04-jonas-schenlli-bip150-bip151/
I think we should continue to use #bitcoin-core-dev for anything about changing Bitcoin Core and try to keep things open even though we&amp;rsquo;re together here today and tomorrow and the next.
# Wallets and block pruning and rescans Nobody produces P2SH change when they have a native output.</description>

Merkleized abstract syntax trees (MAST) https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-September/014932.html
I am going to talk about the scheme I posted to the mailing list yesterday which is to implement MAST (merkleized abstract syntax trees) in bitcoin in a minimally invasive way as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s broken into two major consensus features that together gives us MAST. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the last BIP.
This is tail-call evaluation. Can we generalize P2SH to give us more general capabilities, than just a single redeem script.</description>

MAST stuff You could directly merkleize scripts if you switch from IF, IFNOT, ELSE with IFJUMP that has the number of bytes.
With graftroot and taproot, you never to do any scripts (which were a hack to get things started). But we&amp;rsquo;re doing validation and computation.
You take every single path it has; so instead, it becomes &amp;hellip; certain condition, or certain not conditions&amp;hellip; You take every possible ifs, you use this, you say it&amp;rsquo;s one of these, then you specify which one, and you show it and everyone else can validate this.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s an ex-Google product director interested in helping with Bitcoin Core. He was asking about how to get involved. I told him to get involved by just diving in. He will be spending some time at Chaincode at the end of March. We&amp;rsquo;ll get a sense for what his skills are.</description>

SIGHASH_NOINPUT A bunch of us are familiar with NOINPUT. Does anyone need an explainer? What&amp;rsquo;s the difference from the original NOINPUT and the new one? NOINPUT is kind of scary to at least some people. If we just do NOINPUT, does that start causing problems in bitcoin?</description>

Signature aggregation Sipa, can you sign and verify ECDSA signatures by hand? No. Over GF(43), maybe. Inverses could take a little bit to compute. Over GF(2).
I think the first thing we should talk about is some definitions. I&amp;rsquo;d like to start by distinguishing between three things: Key aggregation, signature aggregation, and batch validation. Multi-signature later.
There are three different problems. Key aggregation is where there are a number of people with each their own key, they want to produce a combined key that can only sign when they come together.</description>

Introduction I am going to talk a little bit about signet. Does anyone not know what signet is? The idea is to have a signature of the block or the previous block. The idea is that testnet is horribly broken for testing things, especially testing things for long-term. You have large reorgs on testnet. What about testnet with a less broken difficulty adjustment? Testnet is for miner testing really.</description>

I am trying to make a new signmessage to do other things. Just use the signature system inside bitcoin to sign a message. Sign a message that someone wants. You can use proof-of-funds or whatever.
You could just have a signature and it&amp;rsquo;s a signature inside of a package and it&amp;rsquo;s small and easy. Another option is to have a .. that is invalid somehow. You do a transaction with some input, where the txid is the message hash or something.</description>

Introduction I am going to talk casually through the whole statechains thing. If you want to interject, please do. I&amp;rsquo;ll get started. The current idea is to make it completely blind. It&amp;rsquo;s blinded statechains. The goal is to allow people to transfer a UTXO without changing anything on-chain.</description>

Introduction Okay, so, first question- who put my name on that list and what do they want? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t me. I&amp;rsquo;ll ask questions. I can give a summary, but there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk already and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to focus on. What would sipa like us to review in particular about it? What design decisions do you feel least confident about?</description>

graftroot The idea of graftroot is that in every contract there is a superset of people that can spend the money. This assumption is not always true but it&amp;rsquo;s almost always true. Say you want to lock up these coins for a year, without any conditionals to it, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. But assume you have&amp;ndash; pubkey recovery? No&amp;hellip; pubkey recovery is inherently incompatible with any form of aggregation, and aggregation is far superior.</description>

      <description>Utreexo: hash-based accumulator for bitcoin UTXOs

Introduction You still download everything; instead of writing to your UTXO database, you modify your accumulator. You accept a proof that it&amp;rsquo;s in the UTXO accumulator, you put it in there yourself, you just don&amp;rsquo;t remember it anymore. The end result is that you store less than a kilobyte instead of 4 GB or so. But the downside is that you need all these proofs.</description>

If people saw Benedikt&amp;rsquo;s talk, two days ago, it&amp;rsquo;s related. It&amp;rsquo;s a different construction but same goal. The basic idea is, and I think Cory kind of started to talk about this a few months ago on the mailing list&amp;hellip; instead of storing all UTXOs in leveldb, store the hash of each UTXO, and then it&amp;rsquo;s half the size, and then you could almost create it from the hash of the input, it&amp;rsquo;s like 10 bytes more.</description>

Bitcoin Core wallet architecture + descriptors
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136282460675878915
writeup: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16165
Wallet architecture discussion There are three main areas here. One is IsMine: how do I determine a particular output is affecting my wallet? What about asking for a new address, where is it coming from? That&amp;rsquo;s not just get new address, it&amp;rsquo;s get raw change address, it&amp;rsquo;s also change being created in fundrawtransaction. The third issue is wallet signing. Storage is not an entrypoint, it&amp;rsquo;s just a way of implementing these things.</description>

Wallet stuff Maybe we can have the wallet PRs have a different review process so that there can be some specialization, even if the wallet is not ready to be split out. In the future, if the wallet was a separate project or repository, then that would be better. We need to be able to subdivide the work better than we already do, and the wallet is a good place to start doing it.</description>
