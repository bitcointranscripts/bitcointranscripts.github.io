Simplicity white paper: https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf
Intro So Simplicity is a programming language that I have been working on at Blockstream. I call it an alternative or reimagination of Bitcoin Script as it would have been if I had invented Bitcoin. An alternative or new instruction set that is compatible with Bitcoin. It could be soft forked in. We’ve experimented with it on sidechains such as Elements or Liquid.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Aggregation And Propagation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/knowledge-aggregation-and-propagation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/knowledge-aggregation-and-propagation/</guid><description>Intro https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1uRy10dBBcxrnzjdUaO2y03f5H34yFlxktOcanvVYE/edit

I&amp;rsquo;ll be the contrarian - I think academia is awful and should be destroyed.
Reputation is completely independent of content and should not be the mechanism by which you judge the quality of research; your reputation is worthless to me. (laughter)
My perspective: [first, slidemaker&amp;rsquo;s regret! might have reorganized this] I&amp;rsquo;m a bitcoin core developer. Also worked at LedgerX (4 years). I also work on biotech on the hobbyist side, garage engineering &amp;ndash; what I was doing when bitcoin was launched.</description></item><item><title>Threshold Schnorr Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/threshold-schnorr-signatures/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/threshold-schnorr-signatures/</guid><description>Topic: The Quest for Practical Threshold Schnorr Signatures

Transcript completed by: Bryan Bishop Edited by: Michael Folkson
Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s great to be here. My name is Tim Ruffing and I work for the research team at Blockstream. This is a talk about practical threshold Schnorr signatures and our quest for constructing them.
Disclaimer First of all, this is work in progress. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty early work in progress, mostly based on discussions with people at Blockstream.</description></item><item><title>All About Decentralized Trust</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/all-about-decentralized-trust/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/all-about-decentralized-trust/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;

This is a clickbaity title, I realize. But the reason I say it is because it&amp;rsquo;s become a mantra for at least myself but for the people who hear me banging my hands on the desk all the time. I am Cory Fields and I work here at the MIT DCI. I am also a Bitcoin Core developer. I am less active these days there because I have been spending some time looking at some higher layer stuff.</description></item><item><title>Flash Boys V2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/flash-boys-v2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/flash-boys-v2/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;

It&amp;rsquo;s basically open-source funding. It&amp;rsquo;s a subset of open-source funding. But these are similar problems with many open-source projects. As far as I can tell, all these digital currency cryptocurrency projects are licensed with open-source licenses. There may be some that are not, and some things are patented. I generally steer clear of the patented work. If it&amp;rsquo;s decentralized and open-source, then why are you just delivering a binary to me?</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/introduction/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;

Introduction Thank you. I am Ethan Heilman. I am a research whose has done a bunch of work in security of cryptocurrencies. I am also CTO of Arwen which does secure atomic swaps. I am a little sick today so please excuse my coughing, wheezing and drinking lots of water.

Carl Dong (Chaincode Labs)
Introduction I am Carl and I work at Chaincode Labs and I will be talking about software, binaries and trust. I am happy that Ethan talked about his subject because it ties into my talk. For the purposes of this talk, assume that everything is perfect and there&amp;rsquo;s no bugs and no CVEs and all the things that Ethan talked about don&amp;rsquo;t exist.</description></item><item><title>Solving The Blockchain Trilemma</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;

Today, Sia is the only decentralized storage platform out there. I also founded Obelisk which is a mining equipment manufacturing company.
Mining supply chains are centralized Basically all the mining chips are coming out of TSMC or Samsung. For the longest time it was TSMC but for some reason Samsung is at the forefront for this cycle but I would expect them to fade out in the next cycle.</description></item><item><title>Zksharks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/zksharks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/zksharks/</guid><description>zkSHARKs
Introduction Indeed I am Madars Virza. I am going to talk about SHARKs. I am going to be talking about zero-knowledge SHARKs. It&amp;rsquo;s actually something serious and it&amp;rsquo;s related to non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.
Non-interactive zero knowledge proofs zkproofs are protocols between two parties, a prover and a verifier. Both prover and verifier know a public input, but only the prover knows a secret input as a witness. The prover wants to convince the verifier that some relationship holds between the public input and the secret witness.</description></item></channel></rss>
