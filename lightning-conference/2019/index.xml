Intro My name is Nadav Kohen. I’m a software engineer at Suredbits. I’m going to talk about payment points which have been alluded to throughout the conference by various talks.
Hash Timelocked Contract (HTLC) Routing First of all, some preliminaries, HTLCs. I don’t think I’m going to spend much time on this slide. We all know what they are. For every hop forward you add a hash timelocked contract.</description></item><item><title>Rust Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-antoine-riard-rust-lightning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-antoine-riard-rust-lightning/</guid><description>Deploying rust-lightning in the wild

Intro Hi everyone, super happy to be here at the Lightning Conference. I’ve had an awesome weekend. Today I will talk on rust-lightning a project I’ve been contributing to for a year and a half. To get started, please take photos of the slides, not of me. So the story of rust-lightning. The idea was to build something really flexible, something really modular.</description></item><item><title>Trampoline Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-bastien-teinturier-trampoline-routing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-bastien-teinturier-trampoline-routing/</guid><description>The Lightning Conference Day 2 (Stage 2)

Intro We will start with gory technical details about routing and pathfinding. I hope I will be able to keep you awake for the next twenty minutes. I’m working for ACINQ on the Lightning Network. If you don’t know ACINQ we are contributors to the specification.

Intro Hi. My name is Rusty Russell and this is actually my official job title at Blockstream, code contributor. It is generic, it is flexible, it is probably a little too humble maybe but that is me. Before we begin the main part of this talk I want to tell you a story.</description></item><item><title>Private Key Management</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-19-chris-stewart-private-key-management/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-19-chris-stewart-private-key-management/</guid><description>Lightning 101 for Exchanges: Private Key Management

Intro Hi everybody. My name is Chris Stewart. I’m the Founder of a company called Suredbits. We monetize APIs with Lightning but we strongly believe that the quickest way to widespread Lightning adoption is through exchanges. As other people have said at this conference most cryptocurrency economic activity does happen through exchanges right now.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Payment Pathfinding for Reliability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/lightning-payment-pathfinding-for-reliability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/lightning-payment-pathfinding-for-reliability/</guid><description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m Joost Jager. I work for Lightning Labs. At Lightning Labs, I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, and my main focus is on LND. Over the last month, I spent quite some time to improve pathfinding in LND. In this talk, I would like to explain how we optimize pathfinding for the reliability of paths.
