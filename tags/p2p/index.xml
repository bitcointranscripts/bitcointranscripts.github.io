Started working on this about 2 years ago; in 2021. After we accidentally observed the address flooding anomaly/attack Primarily uses https://github.com/0xB10C/peer-observer to extract data from Bitcoin Core nodes with tracepoints. The infrastructure also includes a fork-observer connected to each node as well as an addrman-observer for each node. Additionally, detailed Bitcoin Core debug logs are avaliable. The main part are the Grafana dashboards. There’s a public version at public.peer.observer, which is redacted to not leak honeynode IP addresses.</description></item><item><title>Private tx broadcast</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2024-04/private-tx-broadcast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2024-04/private-tx-broadcast/</guid><description>Updates:
TX is validated before broadcast (using mempool test). The sender ignores incoming messages from the receiver (except the handshake and PONG), so the sender cannot send back the tx before disconnection. When it receives the tx back, it becomes &amp;ldquo;just a tx in mempool&amp;rdquo;. TODO/NICE TO HAVE
Check if the wallet is going to rebroadcast a tx it has created but has been broadcast via private broadcast and if yes, prevent that.</description></item><item><title>P2P Design Goals</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/p2p-design-goals/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/p2p-design-goals/</guid><description>Guiding Questions What are we trying to achieve?
What are we trying to prevent?
How so we weight performance over privacy?
What is our tolerance level for net attacks?
Are we trying to add stuff to the network or are we trying to prevent people getting information?
Network topology: By design we are trying to prevent the topology being known Information creation, addresses, txs or blocks
We want blocks at tips fast - consensus critical information needs to be as fast as possible - ability to get the information - forgetting that there are multiple networks - the purpose is to know what the current most work chain tip is Even the addr relay network - everything falls apart if you can’t get that information The crux of the p2p network is to propagate what is the most work Txs can take much much longer but don’t want to leak the source of the origin The privacy implications of Txs makes it difficult Could give up fast propagations for privacy for txs that would be fine but not for blocks.</description></item><item><title>P2P working session</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/p2p-working-session/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/p2p-working-session/</guid><description>Erlay Gleb is active and ready to move forward - #21515 Are there people generally interested in review?

In this episode, they discuss a recent attack on the Bitcoin network, where some nodes were flooding peers with fake IP-addresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As previously discussed in episode 13, Bitcoin nodes connect to peers on the network through IP-addresses, which they learn from their existing peers. Nodes on the network essentially share the IP-addresses of other nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, however, some Bitcoin nodes shared large amounts of IP-addresses that weren’t associated with real Bitcoin nodes at all. While this attack did not do very much damage, it did waste resources from nodes on the network. On top of that, Aaron and Sjors explain, the attack could offer the attacker insight into Bitcoin’s network topology by analyzing how the fake IP-addresses spread through the network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Aaron and Sjors discuss how the attack was solved by rate limiting the amount of IP-addresses than any node will allow its peers to be shared. Further, they consider how in free and open source software development, fixing problems is not always as straightforward as it may seem…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The P2P network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/the-p2p-network-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/the-p2p-network-2/</guid><description>P2P experts Amiti Uttarwar and Pieter Wuille discuss various aspects of peer-to-peer communication in Bitcoin, with Adam Jonas facilitating the conversation.

Bitcoin To start with the fundamentals. As we all know Bitcoin is a money and it is different to our existing centralized solution of money because instead we have nodes that are running all around the world.

We are 25 minutes behind schedule.
We have the rest of the team wathcing remotely. I think the motivation for this project is clear. Transaction volume on the bitcoin network could be growing exponentially except that there is a limit on the number of confirmed transactions. Transaction fees have increased and confirmation times are not reliable, and bitcoin is unusable for some applications.
Some people want to see the max blokc size limit lifted.</description></item><item><title>Bip150 Bip151</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-09-04-jonas-schnelli-bip150-bip151/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-09-04-jonas-schnelli-bip150-bip151/</guid><description>bip150 and bip151: Bitcoin p2p network encryption and authentication

But I was doing it anyway.
The problem is that blocks are transmitted in their entirety. If you have a 1 MB uplink and you&amp;rsquo;re connecting to 8 peers, your first peer will see a 1MB block in about 66.8 seconds. And the last one will get it in 76.4 seconds, because we basically blast out blocks in parallel to our peers. Miners can solve this problem of slow block transmission by centralizing and all using the same pool.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network and Mempool</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2017/p2p-john-newbery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2017/p2p-john-newbery/</guid><description>John Newbery covers the primitives and functionality that comprises Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.

The problem I am going to focus on in this presentation is how to relay information to a new block, to a neighbor, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about next. This would be on the fast relay network or on the regular p2p network. It&amp;rsquo;s about avoiding a situation where, the naieve situation is to send the entire block data.</description></item><item><title>Issues Impacting Block Size Proposals</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/issues-impacting-block-size-proposals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/issues-impacting-block-size-proposals/</guid><description>Issues impacting block size proposals

Bitcoin was introduced as a p2p electronic cash system. That&amp;rsquo;s what it says in the whitepaper. That&amp;rsquo;s what the users were exposed to. The 1 MB block size was set for anti-spam purposes. Otherwise when bitcoin value is low, it&amp;rsquo;s trivial to DOS the network with large blocks.
Moving on to some observations. The process of finding distributed ocnsensus takes time; it&amp;rsquo;s a settlement system.</description></item><item><title>Reworking Bitcoin Core P2P Code For Robustness And Event Driven</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/reworking-bitcoin-core-p2p-code-for-robustness-and-event-driven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/reworking-bitcoin-core-p2p-code-for-robustness-and-event-driven/</guid><description>That is me. I want to apologize right off. I am here to talk about reworking Bitcoin Core p2p code. This is a Bitcoin Core specific topic. I have been working on some software for the past few weeks to talk about working things rather than theory. The presentation is going to suffer because of this.
Bitcoin Core has a networking stack that dates back all the way to the initial implementation from Satoshi or at least it&amp;rsquo;s been patched and hacked on ever since.</description></item><item><title>Validation Costs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/validation-costs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/validation-costs/</guid><description>Validation costs and incentives
How many of you have read the Satoshi whitepaper? It&amp;rsquo;s a good paper. As we have discovered, it has some serious limitations that we think can be fixed but they are serious challenges for scaling. Amongst these are, it was really built as a single code base which was meant to be run in its entirety. All machines were going to participate equally in this p2p network.</description></item></channel></rss>
