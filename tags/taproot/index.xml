Introduction This is a talk about MuSig2, simple two round Schnorr multisignatures. I am Jonas Nick and this work is a collaboration with my colleague Tim Ruffing at Blockstream and Yannick Seurin.
Multi-Signatures Multisignatures allow n signers to produce a single signature on a single message. The signing protocol can be interactive and require multiple communication rounds.</description></item><item><title>Andrew Poelstra - Threshold Signatures And Accountability (2019-02-04)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-02-04-threshold-signatures-and-accountability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-02-04-threshold-signatures-and-accountability/</guid><description>Name: Andrew Poelstra

Why Schnorr and why taproot? Who here already feels comfortbale with Schnorr/Taproot? This is a proposed consensus change to bitcoin. When we talk about consensus changes, we often talk about tradeoffs and compromises. It would be irresponsible to say taproot has no downsides, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to mention it&amp;rsquo;s a clear win for bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Protocol Development Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/bitcoin-protocol-development-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/bitcoin-protocol-development-panel/</guid><description>Video: https://youtu.be/8B1fX2i4dMY

Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow? Taproot has been discussed for 2.5 years already and by the time it would activate it will certainly at this point be over three years.
The bulk of the Taproot proposal, other than Taproot itself and specific encoding details, is significantly older too.</description></item><item><title>Improving Bitcoin Smart Contract Efficiency</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2018/improving-bitcoin-smart-contract-efficiency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2018/improving-bitcoin-smart-contract-efficiency/</guid><description>Improving efficiency of smart contracts on the bitcoin network

John Newbery: Alright, Security Models. This is going to be like a quick whistle-stop tour of various things, very high-level view. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by giving you some kind of framework to think about things. So in cryptography, we often talk about security proofs in terms of existing schemes, we talk about assumptions.
So, for example&amp;hellip; If you can break new scheme B, then you&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to break old scheme A.</description></item><item><title>Jonas Nick, Tim Ruffing - MuSig, MuSig-DN and MuSig2 (2020-10-27)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-10-27-jonas-nick-tim-ruffing-musig2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-10-27-jonas-nick-tim-ruffing-musig2/</guid><description>Name: Jonas Nick and Tim Ruffing

Intro Stephan Livera (SL): Luke, welcome to the show.
Luke Dashjr (LD): Thanks.
SL: So, Luke for listeners who are unfamiliar, maybe you could take a minute and tell us a little bit about your background and how long you’ve been developing and contributing with Bitcoin Core.</description></item><item><title>Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees - MAST (2018-03-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-06-merkleized-abstract-syntax-trees-mast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-06-merkleized-abstract-syntax-trees-mast/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/972120890279432192

MAST stuff You could directly merkleize scripts if you switch from IF, IFNOT, ELSE with IFJUMP that has the number of bytes.
With graftroot and taproot, you never to do any scripts (which were a hack to get things started). But we&amp;rsquo;re doing validation and computation.
You take every single path it has; so instead, it becomes &amp;hellip; certain condition, or certain not conditions&amp;hellip; You take every possible ifs, you use this, you say it&amp;rsquo;s one of these, then you specify which one, and you show it and everyone else can validate this.</description></item><item><title>Secure Protocols Bip Taproot</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/secure-protocols-bip-taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/secure-protocols-bip-taproot/</guid><description>Secure protocols on BIP-taproot

Introduction I am going to tlak about something that is a collaboration of many people in the bitcoin community including my colleagues at Blockstream. The bip-taproot proposal was recently posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list which proposes an improvement for bitcoin.
Disclaimer It&amp;rsquo;s not at all certain that a bip-taproot soft-fork will activate in its current form or at all.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar - BIP Taproot (2020-07-21)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-07-21-socratic-seminar-bip-taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-07-21-socratic-seminar-bip-taproot/</guid><description>Name: Socratic Seminar

We have sort of done two meetups in this format. The idea here is that in NY there&amp;rsquo;s BitDevs which is one of the oldest meetups. This has been going on for five years. They have a format called socratic where they have a talented guy named J who leads them through some topics and they try to get some discussion going on and pull from expertise in the audience.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar 6 (2020-02-24)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2020-02-24-socratic-seminar-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2020-02-24-socratic-seminar-6/</guid><description>Austin Bitcoin Developers socratic seminar 6

Introduction Alrighty, let&amp;rsquo;s get started. Gather around. Phil could use some company here. Nobody likes the front row. Maybe the benches. So I have a little different format for how I want to do it this week. Usually I cover a broad series of topics that I steal from the New York&amp;rsquo;s meetup list. Going through that, I thought there was something that looked interesting which was the new taproot proposals that were finally posted by Pieter Wuille.</description></item><item><title>Sydney Socratic Seminar (2021-02-23)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2021-02-23-socratic-seminar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2021-02-23-socratic-seminar/</guid><description>Name: Socratic Seminar

Introduction Okay, so, first question- who put my name on that list and what do they want? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t me. I&amp;rsquo;ll ask questions. I can give a summary, but there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk already and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to focus on. What would sipa like us to review in particular about it?

Introduction Taproot and graftroot are recent proposals in the bitcoin world. Every script type looks different and they are distinct. From a privacy perspective, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty bad. You watermark or fingerprint yourself all the time by showing unique scripts on the blockchain or in your transactions. This causes censorship risks and other problems for fungibility. Often you are paying for contigencies that are never used, like the whoopsies branches in your scripts.</description></item><item><title>Taproot, Graftroot, Etc (2018-03-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-06-taproot-graftroot-etc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-06-taproot-graftroot-etc/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/972468121046061056
graftroot The idea of graftroot is that in every contract there is a superset of people that can spend the money. This assumption is not always true but it&amp;rsquo;s almost always true. Say you want to lock up these coins for a year, without any conditionals to it, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. But assume you have&amp;ndash; pubkey recovery? No&amp;hellip; pubkey recovery is inherently incompatible with any form of aggregation, and aggregation is far superior.</description></item><item><title>Tim Ruffing - MuSig2 (2021-01-12)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/realworldcrypto/2021/2021-01-12-tim-ruffing-musig2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/realworldcrypto/2021/2021-01-12-tim-ruffing-musig2/</guid><description>Name: Tim Ruffing

Introduction This is about MuSig2, simple two round Schnorr multisignatures. This is joint work with Jonas Nick and Yannick Seurin. Jonas will be available to answer questions as I will be of course.
Multi-Signatures The idea that with multisignatures is that n signers can get together and produce a single signature on a single message.</description></item><item><title>Tim Ruffing - Schnorr, Multisig (2020-06-17)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-06-17-tim-ruffing-schnorr-multisig/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-06-17-tim-ruffing-schnorr-multisig/</guid><description>Name: Tim Ruffing
