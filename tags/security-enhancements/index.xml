The initial idea is shipping a map file every Core release. Fabian wrote an article about how would be integrated into the deployment (https://gist.github.com/fjahr/f879769228f4f1c49b49d348f80d7635). Some devs pointed out an option would be to have it separated to the release process, any regular contributor could update it whenever they like (who would do it? frequency?). Then when the release comes around one of the recent ones will be chosen.</description></item><item><title>Provably bug-free BIPs and implementations using hac-spec</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2022/2022-10-14-hac-spec/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2022/2022-10-14-hac-spec/</guid><description>https://nickler.ninja/
Alright. Strong crowd here, I can see. That&amp;rsquo;s very nice.
Introduction I am Jonas and I will talk about provably bug-free BIPs and implementations. I don&amp;rsquo;t have such a BIP nor such an implementation but if you lower your time-preference enough this could eventually be true at some point. This presentation is only 15 minutes so raise your hand if you have questions.
Just to set the stage. Specifications should be free of bugs, we want them easy to implement and hard to misinterpret.</description></item><item><title>Erebus Attacks And How To Stop Them With ASMAP</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/erebus-attacks-and-how-to-stop-them-with-asmap/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/erebus-attacks-and-how-to-stop-them-with-asmap/</guid><description>Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:07
Live from Utrecht, this is The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado.

Hello!
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:10
Hey Sjors. What&amp;rsquo;s up? We got a market cap all time high, did you celebrate?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:14
No, I did not because it&amp;rsquo;s just dilution.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:16
What do you mean?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:17
I mean somebody&amp;rsquo;s making more Bitcoin. So it&amp;rsquo;s fun that the market cap goes up, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter unless you&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/on-the-security-and-performance-of-proof-of-work-blockchains/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/on-the-security-and-performance-of-proof-of-work-blockchains/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/785066988532068352
As most of you might know, in bitcoin and blockchains, the information is very important. Every node should receive the blocks in the network. Increase latency and risk network partition. If individual peers do not get the information, they could be victims of selfish mining and so on. Multiple blockchains has been proposed, multiple reparameterizations like litecoin, dogecoin, ethereum and others. One of the key changes they did was the block interval time.</description></item></channel></rss>
