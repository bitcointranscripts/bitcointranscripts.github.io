The initial idea is shipping a map file every Core release. Fabian wrote an article about how would be integrated into the deployment (https://gist.github.com/fjahr/f879769228f4f1c49b49d348f80d7635). Some devs pointed out an option would be to have it separated to the release process, any regular contributor could update it whenever they like (who would do it? frequency?). Then when the release comes around one of the recent ones will be chosen.</description></item><item><title>Erebus Attacks And How To Stop Them With ASMAP</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/erebus-attacks-and-how-to-stop-them-with-asmap/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/erebus-attacks-and-how-to-stop-them-with-asmap/</guid><description>Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:07

Hello!
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:10
Hey Sjors. What&amp;rsquo;s up? We got a market cap all time high, did you celebrate?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:14
No, I did not because it&amp;rsquo;s just dilution.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:16
What do you mean?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:17
I mean somebody&amp;rsquo;s making more Bitcoin. So it&amp;rsquo;s fun that the market cap goes up, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter unless you&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/on-the-security-and-performance-of-proof-of-work-blockchains/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/on-the-security-and-performance-of-proof-of-work-blockchains/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/785066988532068352
As most of you might know, in bitcoin and blockchains, the information is very important. Every node should receive the blocks in the network. Increase latency and risk network partition. If individual peers do not get the information, they could be victims of selfish mining and so on. Multiple blockchains has been proposed, multiple reparameterizations like litecoin, dogecoin, ethereum and others. One of the key changes they did was the block interval time.</description></item></channel></rss>
