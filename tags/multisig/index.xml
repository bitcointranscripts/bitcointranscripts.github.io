MuSig2 paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261.pdf
Introduction This is a talk about MuSig2, simple two round Schnorr multisignatures. I am Jonas Nick and this work is a collaboration with my colleague Tim Ruffing at Blockstream and Yannick Seurin.
Multi-Signatures Multisignatures allow n signers to produce a single signature on a single message. The signing protocol can be interactive and require multiple communication rounds.</description></item><item><title>Armory Proof Of Payment</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/armory-proof-of-payment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/armory-proof-of-payment/</guid><description>Armory proof of payment

I am going to talk about proof of payment. This is simple. You can do this. That you couldn&amp;rsquo;t do before 2008. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if this works. I hear it might work. That&amp;rsquo;s okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll pull this up here. I have ruined everything. Just jam that in there. Here we go.

Threshold signatures
I want to tell you what threshold signatures are and I want to convince you that threshold signatures are a technology you need. This is collaborative work.
There are three things I want to tell you today. The first is that the banking security model has been very very refined and has sophisticated techniques and process and controls for ensuring security. It does not translate to Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Bellare Neven (2018-03-05)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-05-bellare-neven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-05-bellare-neven/</guid><description>See also http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation/
Bellare-Neven It&amp;rsquo;s been published, it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a decade, and it&amp;rsquo;s widely cited. In Bellare-Neven, it&amp;rsquo;s itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a multi-signature scheme which means multiple pubkeys and one message. You should treat the individual authorizations to spend inputs, as individual messages. What we need is an interactive aggregate signature scheme. Bellare-Neven&amp;rsquo;s paper suggests a trivial way of building an aggregate signature scheme out of a multisig scheme where interactively everyone signs everyone&amp;rsquo;s message.</description></item><item><title>Custody Group</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/custody-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/custody-group/</guid><description>2109-09-08

One of the problems in the ecosystem was nomenclature. We started working on a report about what features a nomenclature would have. Airgaps, constant-time software, sidechannel resistance, Faraday cage, deterministic software, entropy, blind signatures, proof-of-reserve, multi-vendor hardware to minimize compromise. Multi-location and multi-sig. Insurance guarantee scheme. Canaries, dead man switches, tripwires, heartbeat mechanisms. Shamir&amp;rsquo;s secret sharing vs multisig. The second part of this report was going to be market analysis.</description></item><item><title>Future Of Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/future-of-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/future-of-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>The future of hardware wallets

Introduction We are making a secure hardware platform for developers so that they can build their own hardware wallets. Today I want to talk about certain challenges for hardware wallets, what we&amp;rsquo;re missing, and how we can get better.
Current capabilities of hardware wallets Normally, hardware wallets keep keys reasonably secret and are able to spend coins or sign transactions.</description></item><item><title>Gavinandresen</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/bitcoin-devcore-2015/gavinandresen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/bitcoin-devcore-2015/gavinandresen/</guid><description>http://blog.circle.com/2015/02/10/devcore-livestream/
The instant transaction time.. you know I walk up to a cash register, I put my phone there, and in a second or two the transaction is confirmed and I walk away with my coffee. Anything beyond that, 10 minutes versus 1 minute doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. So the problem you want to solve is how do we get instant confirmation.. there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of ideas about this, like a trusted third party that promises to not double spend, have some coins locked up in a multisig wallet like Green Address.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - Checkmultisig Bug (2020-08-27)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-08-27-greg-maxwell-checkmultisig-bug/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-08-27-greg-maxwell-checkmultisig-bug/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

What is stopping the OP_CHECKMULTISIG extra pop bug from being fixed? I think it is probably wrong to describe it as a bug. I think it was intended to indicate which signatures were present to fix the otherwise terrible performance of CHECKMULTISIG.
Regardless, there is no real point to fixing it: Any &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; would require that all software using CHECKMULTISIG get an incompatible change (as part of a highly disruptive hard fork).</description></item><item><title>Jonas Nick, Tim Ruffing - MuSig, MuSig-DN and MuSig2 (2020-10-27)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-10-27-jonas-nick-tim-ruffing-musig2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-10-27-jonas-nick-tim-ruffing-musig2/</guid><description>Name: Jonas Nick and Tim Ruffing

Okay. Hello everyone. Yes, okay, great. Yes. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m working on Lightning Network. Bitcoin is great and fun to work on.
Basic super quick summary of Lightning I am going to re-cap lightning network real quick. The basic idea is to have channels between two nodes. A channel, from the perspective of the rest of the world, is just a 2-of-2 multisig output.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/lightning-network-routing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/lightning-network-routing/</guid><description>Lightning network routing: Operation, issues and expansions
Carla Kirk-Cohen
Introduction Good afternoon everyone. My name is Carla. I am one of the chaincode residents this summer. This talk is going to walk through the protocol layer by layer and look at the different components that make up the network. Lightning is an off-chain scaling solution which consists of a p2p network of payment channels. It allows payments to be forwarded by nodes in exchange for fees.</description></item><item><title>Petertodd Dex</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/w3-blockchain-workshop-2016/petertodd-dex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/w3-blockchain-workshop-2016/petertodd-dex/</guid><description>petertodd
I have been working on deterministic expressions language called DEX. It looks like lambda calculus. But really we&amp;rsquo;re trying to create a way to specify expressions that would return true if a signature is valid. Something like this, which is really just check a signature against a pubkey for a message, is essentially something that would be baked into your software anyway. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to move into a layer of abstraction where you can specify the conditions you need for your particular use case.</description></item><item><title>Pieter Wuille - Key Tree Signatures (2015-08-24)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2015-08-24-pieter-wuille-key-tree-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2015-08-24-pieter-wuille-key-tree-signatures/</guid><description>Name: Pieter Wuille

Introduction I am going to talk about why we have scripts in bitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;ll give some examples and the design philosophy. I am not going to talk about the semantics of bitcoin script, though. Why do we have bitcoin script? I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to lock and unlock coins. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about pay-to-pubkey, multisig, and computing vs verification in the blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Signature Aggregation (2017-09-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation/</guid><description>﻿https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/907065194463072258
Signature aggregation Sipa, can you sign and verify ECDSA signatures by hand? No. Over GF(43), maybe. Inverses could take a little bit to compute. Over GF(2).
I think the first thing we should talk about is some definitions. I&amp;rsquo;d like to start by distinguishing between three things: Key aggregation, signature aggregation, and batch validation. Multi-signature later.
There are three different problems. Key aggregation is where there are a number of people with each their own key, they want to produce a combined key that can only sign when they come together.</description></item><item><title>Smart Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/w3-blockchain-workshop-2016/smart-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/w3-blockchain-workshop-2016/smart-signatures/</guid><description>Christopher Allen
Smart signatures and smarter signatures
Signatures are a 50+ year old technology. I am talking about the digital signature. It&amp;rsquo;s a hash of an object that has been encrypted by private key and verified by a public key against the hash of the object. All of our systems are using this in a varity of complex ways at high level to either do identity, sign a block, or do a variety of different things.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar (2020-05-19)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2020-05-19-socratic-seminar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2020-05-19-socratic-seminar/</guid><description>Name: Socratic Seminar

Introduction I am going to be talking about the state of multisig. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of creating a transaction output that requires multiple keys to sign. This is a focus for people holding bitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about some of the benefits and some of the issues. I am not a security expert, though.
Perspective Multisig is an emphasis on saving and not spending a lot.</description></item><item><title>Threshold Scriptless Scripts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/threshold-scriptless-scripts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/threshold-scriptless-scripts/</guid><description>Threshold scriptless scripts

Scriptless scripts We can write smart contracts in bitcoin today, but there&amp;rsquo;s some limitations. We can do a lot of great things. We can do atomic swaps, multisig, payment channels, etc. There&amp;rsquo;s a cost, though. Transactions become bigger with bigger scripts. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of heavy on the verifiers. The verifiers now need to verify more things. There&amp;rsquo;s also privacy issues because you put your contract publicly on chain.</description></item><item><title>Tim Ruffing - MuSig2 (2021-01-12)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/realworldcrypto/2021/2021-01-12-tim-ruffing-musig2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/realworldcrypto/2021/2021-01-12-tim-ruffing-musig2/</guid><description>Name: Tim Ruffing

Dictionary terms: we have a glossary that I wrote 6 months ago which by definition glosses everything. A dictionary would give an opportunity to go into more depth, to look at disagreements without getting lost in the weeds, and also talk about some foundational assumptions.
Verifiable secret sharing: this is a modification for Shamir secret sharing that also incorporates multisignatures as well. We&amp;rsquo;re interested in solidifying that into an actual proposal and talk about the pro&amp;rsquo;s of con&amp;rsquo;s of traditional secret sharing and this scheme and whether you should be using multisig as opposed to Shamir secret sharing in your application and provide some guidance there.</description></item></channel></rss>
