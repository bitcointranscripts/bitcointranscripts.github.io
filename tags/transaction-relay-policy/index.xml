Explained.
Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:24
Hey, Sjors, we&amp;rsquo;re back. We&amp;rsquo;re back in beautiful, sunny Utrecht after I spent some time in Miami and Prague. You spent some time in Prague, and more Prague, is that right?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:38
Mostly Prague.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:38
You were in Prague for a while. That&amp;rsquo;s where we recorded the previous episode about Stratum V2.</description></item><item><title>OP_RETURN</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/op_return/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/op_return/</guid><description>Intro Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:19
Live from Utrecht, this is Bitcoin Explained. Hey Sjors.
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:24
What&amp;rsquo;s up?
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:25
How exciting. Two weeks ago you told me that maybe you would go to Bitcoin Amsterdam.
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:31
Yes.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:31
And now you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker.
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:33
I&amp;rsquo;m a panelist, probably not a real speaker.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:37
That counts that that&amp;rsquo;s a speaker in my book Sjors.</description></item><item><title>Tradeoffs in Permissionless Systems</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/tradeoffs-in-permissionless-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/tradeoffs-in-permissionless-systems/</guid><description>Introduction Hello. I wanted to make a talk about what I work on because I consider it the, well, the area of code that I work in, because I considered it to be one of the most fascinating and definitely the most underrated part of Bitcoin that no one ever talks about. And the reason is I kind of see it as where one of the most important ideological goals of Bitcoin translates into technical challenges, which also happens to be very, very interesting.</description></item><item><title>The Mempool (And Why We Need It)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/death-to-the-mempool-long-live-the-mempool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/death-to-the-mempool-long-live-the-mempool/</guid><description>Preamble Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:20

Hey Sjors.

Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:26
I&amp;rsquo;m doing well.
We&amp;rsquo;re still in Utrecht as I just said, but only for a couple more days, I&amp;rsquo;m on my way back to El Salvador for a couple of conferences and I think you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be traveling as well.</description></item><item><title>Transaction Relay Policy for L2 Developers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/adopting-bitcoin/2021/2021-11-16-gloria-zhao-transaction-relay-policy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/adopting-bitcoin/2021/2021-11-16-gloria-zhao-transaction-relay-policy/</guid><description>Slides: https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin-notes/blob/master/Tx%20Relay%20Policy%20for%20L2%20Devs%20-%20Adopting%20Bitcoin%202021.pdf
Intro Hi I’m Gloria, I work on Bitcoin Core at Brink. Today I am going to talk a bit about mempool policy and why you cannot always expect your transactions to propagate or your fee bumps to work. What we are doing to try to resolve stuff like that. This talk is for those of you who find the mempool a bit murky or unstable or unpredictable. You are not really sure if it is an interface you are comfortable building an application on top of.</description></item><item><title>Mempool Analysis &amp; Simulation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-08-mempool-analysis-simulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-08-mempool-analysis-simulation/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137342023063744512

Introduction Fun fact: I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone knows this fact, but antpool is a miner and antpool is not mining replace-by-fee transactions. What I mean by that is that if you do a replace-by-fee transaction, they will ignore the second high fee transaction. There are cases where transactions are RBF-bumped to increase the fee to make it mined faster, so you RBF bump it, and then you have people spending the unconfirmed RBF version and then have a chain of transactions but then the original transaction is mined and not the other chained transactions.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network and Mempool</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2017/p2p-john-newbery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2017/p2p-john-newbery/</guid><description>John Newbery covers the primitives and functionality that comprises Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.
