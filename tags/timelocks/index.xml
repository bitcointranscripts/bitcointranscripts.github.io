Thank you. Alright, yeah, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a talk around Timelocks in Bitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a pretty quick introduction on the different types of Timelocks over time in Bitcoin, and where we&amp;rsquo;re at today. Also, a little bit, very, very quickly talking about what we&amp;rsquo;re using Timelocks for in Bitcoin today.</description></item><item><title>Coinjoin Done Right: the onchain offchain mix (and anti-Sybil with RIDDLE)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/onchain-privacy/coinjoin-done-right-the-onchain-offchain-mix-and-anti-sybil-with-riddles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/onchain-privacy/coinjoin-done-right-the-onchain-offchain-mix-and-anti-sybil-with-riddles/</guid><description>NOTE: Slides of the talk can be found here
Introduction My name&amp;rsquo;s Adam Gibson, also known as waxwing on the internet. Though the title might suggest that I have the solution to the problem of implementing CoinJoin, it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly true. It&amp;rsquo;s a clickbait. I haven&amp;rsquo;t, but I suppose what I can say in a more serious way is that I&amp;rsquo;m proposing what I consider to be a meaningfully different alternative way of looking at the concept of CoinJoin and therefore at the concept of on-chain privacy because the conversation nowadays about on-chain privacy tends to be dominated by CoinJoin.</description></item><item><title>Comments And Observations About Timelocks Ron Rivest</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/verifiable-delay-functions/vdf-day-2019/comments-and-observations-about-timelocks-ron-rivest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/verifiable-delay-functions/vdf-day-2019/comments-and-observations-about-timelocks-ron-rivest/</guid><description>Comments and observations about timelocks and verifiable delay functions
Introduction Welcome everybody. It&amp;rsquo;s not only about solving the puzzles, but the immense interest in verifiable delay functions. When setting up this conference, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected that. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict where technology will go or what things will be popular decades later when you work on something.
I am just going to review some of the basic stuff we did way back when, setting up a puzzle which was just recently solved by Simon and Bernard where&amp;rsquo;s Bernard.</description></item></channel></rss>
