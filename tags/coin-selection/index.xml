The conversation highlights the continuous efforts to refactor and improve the wallet&amp;rsquo;s codebase, addressing challenges and introducing innovations in coin selection and transaction management. The importance of maintaining high security and review standards is underscored, reflecting the wallet&amp;rsquo;s role in supporting Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s core principles. Future directions include improving the wallet&amp;rsquo;s performance, user experience, and GUI.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core 24.0</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v24/</guid><description>Intro Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:20

I&amp;rsquo;m good.

How do you like the weather?
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:29
It was too hot all summer and then it was nice for about a week and now we&amp;rsquo;re back to too cold.

I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer at Blockstream and I work on Bitcoin Core in the wallet and on various things in the wallet. So, today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about coin selection and generally how you can pick your inputs better for when you&amp;rsquo;re making a transaction. To start off, what happens when you make a transaction? Well, first, you type in, you copy and paste in your address, you type in the amount that you want to send and you click the send button and your wallet does some stuff in the background and out comes a transaction, right?</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Wallets/UTXO Management</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-09-enterprise-walletsutxo-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-09-enterprise-walletsutxo-management/</guid><description>Mark Erhardt: 00:00:00
Just to throw out a few numbers there, non-SegWit inputs cost almost 300 bytes, and native SegWit inputs cost slightly more than 100 bytes. There&amp;rsquo;s almost a reduction by two-thirds in fees if you switch from non-SegWit to native SegWit.

Introduction I am going to do a short talk on coin selection. Everyone calls me kalle. In Japanese, my name is kalle. Coin selection, what it is, how it works, and interestingly enough- in the latest version of Bitcoin Core released yesterday, they have changed the coin selection algorithm for the first time since a long time. They are now using something with more scientific rigor behind it (branch-and-bound coin selection), which is good news.</description></item></channel></rss>
