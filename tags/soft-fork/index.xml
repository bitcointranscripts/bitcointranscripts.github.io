Live from Utrecht. This is The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. Hello. Sjors, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about a classic today.
Sjors: 00:01:52
Yeah. We&amp;rsquo;re going to party like it&amp;rsquo;s 2015.
Aaron: 00:01:55
SegWit.
Segregated Witness Sjors: 00:01:56
That&amp;rsquo;s right.
Aaron: 00:01:57
Segregated Witness, which was the previous soft fork, well, was the last soft fork. We&amp;rsquo;re working towards a Taproot soft fork now.
Sjors: 00:02:06
It&amp;rsquo;s the last soft fork we know of.</description></item><item><title>Taproot Activation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-03-17-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-03-17-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</guid><description>Topic: How Bitcoin UASF went down, Taproot LOT=true, Speedy Trial, Small Blocks

Intro Stephan Livera (SL): Luke, welcome to the show.
Luke Dashjr (LD): Thanks.
SL: So, Luke for listeners who are unfamiliar, maybe you could take a minute and tell us a little bit about your background and how long you’ve been developing and contributing with Bitcoin Core.</description></item><item><title>Taproot Activation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/2020-08-03-eric-lombrozo-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/2020-08-03-eric-lombrozo-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</guid><description>Topic: How to Activate a New Soft Fork

Simplicity white paper: https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf
Intro So Simplicity is a programming language that I have been working on at Blockstream. I call it an alternative or reimagination of Bitcoin Script as it would have been if I had invented Bitcoin. An alternative or new instruction set that is compatible with Bitcoin. It could be soft forked in. We’ve experimented with it on sidechains such as Elements or Liquid.</description></item><item><title>Great Consensus Cleanup</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-06-great-consensus-cleanup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-06-great-consensus-cleanup/</guid><description>https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016714.html

Introduction There&amp;rsquo;s not much new to talk about. Unclear about CODESEPARATOR. You want to make it a consensus rule that transactions can&amp;rsquo;t be larger than 100 kb. No reactions to that? Alright. Fine, we&amp;rsquo;re doing it. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it. Does everyone know what this proposal is?
Validation time for any block&amp;ndash; we were lazy about fixing this. Segwit was a first step to fixing this, by giving people a way to do this in a more efficient way.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Full Nodes</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-07-23-john-light-bitcoin-full-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-07-23-john-light-bitcoin-full-nodes/</guid><description>Location: London Bitcoin Devs

Intro My presentation today is going to be about Bitcoin full nodes. Everything you wanted to know and more. There should perhaps be an asterisk because I’m not going to say literally everything but if anyone in the audience has any questions that want to go really deep down the rabbit hole then we’ll see just how far down we can go.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Uasf And Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2017-06-04-consensus-uasf-and-forks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2017-06-04-consensus-uasf-and-forks/</guid><description>On Consensus and All Kinds of Forks

User activated soft forks vs hard forks Adam Levine (AL): I’m trying to look at the user activated soft fork thing and not see hypocrisy just steaming out of its ears. I’m really in need of you to help me understand why this is not the case Andreas. The argument to this point about scaling, one of the arguments, one of the larger arguments, has been that hard forks are the worst thing that can happen.</description></item></channel></rss>
