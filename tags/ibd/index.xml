With Core, there would be some information that we give to every client that tells them whether or not an output is going to enter the utxo set
For simplicity take asssumevalid, you take the same points, the question is, once we reach that point, are the outputs gonna be in the utxo set, create a bitfield, 200mb of data, compressable because you have a bunch of 0s and very few 1s.</description></item><item><title>IBD</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2025-02/ibd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2025-02/ibd/</guid><description>There were two sessions about IBD, these notes are from the first of the two sessions.
Summary of what the facilitator presented:
The motivation for improving IBD performance is that it reduces the cost of a node reaching the tip of the network, and with each marginal reduction in cost, some new number of nodes or node operators that otherwise would not have joined the network because of the associated costs do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
