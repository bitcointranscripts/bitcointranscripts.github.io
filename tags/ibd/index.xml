Intros Michael Folkson (MF): This is a discussion on AssumeUTXO. We are lucky to have James O’Beirne on the call. There is a reading list that I will share in a second with a bunch of links going right from concept, some of the podcasts James has done, a couple of presentations James has done. And then towards the end hopefully we will get pretty technical and in the weeds of some of the current, past and future PRs.</description></item><item><title>Assumeutxo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</guid><description>Assumeutxo

Why assumeutxo assumeutxo is a spiritual continuation of assumevalid. Why do we want to do this in the first place? At the moment, it takes hours and days to do initial block download. Various projects in the community have been implementing meassures to speed this up. Casa I think bundles datadir with their nodes. Other projects like btcpay have various ways of bundling this up and signing things with gpg keys and these solutions are not quite half-baked but they are probably not desirable either.</description></item></channel></rss>
