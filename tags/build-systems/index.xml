I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to Amsterdam this year, but I hope the graphics I have prepared for this talk can make up for my absence. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to be a good bitcoin citizen and start to run your own bitcoin node. Say you go to bitcoincore.org, you click the download button, and you open the disk image and you double click on Bitcoin Core.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Toolchain Unit Testing And Deterministic Builds</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/bitcoin-toolchain-unit-testing-and-deterministic-builds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/bitcoin-toolchain-unit-testing-and-deterministic-builds/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1048103693885759489
Introduction Just to continue on what James said about the build system on Bitcoin Core&amp;hellip; I am going to talk about deterministic builds. I am MarcoFalke and I also work at Chaincode Labs in NYC.
Bitcoin Core Build System The build system is based on autotools, so it should just work anywhere where autotools runs. Just run ./autogen.sh ./configure and then make, that&amp;rsquo;s it.
We recently added support for MSVC builds mostly for Windows developers to do native builds not having to switch between Linux and Windows all the time.</description></item><item><title>Protecting Yourself And Your Business</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/protecting-yourself-and-your-business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/protecting-yourself-and-your-business/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1048087226742071296
Introduction Hello. My name is Warren Togami and I will be talking about exchange security. Not only protecting the people but also the business. This has been a topic of interest recently.
Warren&amp;rsquo;s security background I have some credibility when it comes to security due to my previous career in open-source software. I have been working on the Linux operating system first with Fedora then with Red Hat for many years.</description></item></channel></rss>
