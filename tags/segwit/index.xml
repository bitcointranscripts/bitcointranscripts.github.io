I probably won&amp;rsquo;t get through all of my material. If you have questions during the talk, please feel free to raise your hand and we can cover it right away. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to walk you through a transaction serialization for both a non-segwit transaction and a segwit transaction. By the end of the talk, I hope you understand how the transaction weight is calculated and how the witness discount works.</description></item><item><title>Weighing Transactions, The Witness Discount</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2022/weighing-transactions-the-witness-discount/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2022/weighing-transactions-the-witness-discount/</guid><description>In this talk Mark Erhardt: 0:00:25
I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to walk with you through a transaction serialization, the Bitcoin transaction serialization. And we&amp;rsquo;ll try to understand a non-SegWit transaction and then a SegWit transaction to compare it to. And I hope by the end of this talk, you understand how the transaction weight is calculated and how the witness discount works. And if we get to it, we may take a look at a few different output types in the end as well.</description></item><item><title>Chaincode Decoded: Bech32m</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/chaincode-decoded-bech32m/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/chaincode-decoded-bech32m/</guid><description>This revisits a segment we call Chaincode Decoded.

Live from Utrecht. This is The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. Hello. Sjors, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about a classic today.
Sjors: 00:01:52
Yeah. We&amp;rsquo;re going to party like it&amp;rsquo;s 2015.
Aaron: 00:01:55
SegWit.
Segregated Witness Sjors: 00:01:56
That&amp;rsquo;s right.
Aaron: 00:01:57
Segregated Witness, which was the previous soft fork, well, was the last soft fork. We&amp;rsquo;re working towards a Taproot soft fork now.
Sjors: 00:02:06
It&amp;rsquo;s the last soft fork we know of.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Wallets/UTXO Management</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-09-enterprise-walletsutxo-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-09-enterprise-walletsutxo-management/</guid><description>Mark Erhardt: 00:00:00
Just to throw out a few numbers there, non-SegWit inputs cost almost 300 bytes, and native SegWit inputs cost slightly more than 100 bytes. There&amp;rsquo;s almost a reduction by two-thirds in fees if you switch from non-SegWit to native SegWit.

Location: LA BitDevs (online)
CVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14199
Trezor blog post on the vulnerability: https://blog.trezor.io/latest-firmware-updates-correct-possible-segwit-transaction-vulnerability-266df0d2860
Greg Sanders Bitcoin dev mailing list post in April 2017: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-August/014843.html
The vulnerability The way Bitcoin transactions are encoded in the software is there is a list of coins essentially and then there is a list of destinations and the amount being sent to each destination. The destinations do not include the fee. Nothing in the transaction tells you what the fee of the transaction is.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Segwit</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-18-james-obeirne-advanced-segwit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-18-james-obeirne-advanced-segwit/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs 2019 Residency

James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne: To sort of vamp off of Jonas&amp;rsquo;s preamble, I&amp;rsquo;m not that smart. I&amp;rsquo;m a decent programmer, but compared to a lot of people who work on Bitcoin, I barely know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I kind of consider myself like a carpenter, a digital carpenter equivalent. I&amp;rsquo;m a steady hand. I can get things done. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly patient, which i s key when it comes to Bitcoin Core development because, trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be doing a lot of waiting around and a lot of rebasing.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Optech</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10/2018-10-09-bitcoin-optech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10/2018-10-09-bitcoin-optech/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1049527415767101440

Bitcoin Optech is trying to encourage bitcoin businesses to adopt better scaling techniques and technologies, things like batching, segwit, down the line maybe Schnorr signatures, aggregatable signatures, maybe lightning. Right now we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on things that businesses could be doing right now. Exchanges could be batching, and some aren&amp;rsquo;t. We&amp;rsquo;re talking to those companies and listening to their concerns and what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and just trying to nudge them in the right direction.</description></item><item><title>Light Clients During 2017 Interfork Period</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/light-clients-during-2017-interfork-period/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/light-clients-during-2017-interfork-period/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1005617123287289857
Next up is Thomas.
Introduction Alright. Hello everyone. Thank you for having me. I&amp;rsquo;m the developer of the Electrum wallet. I started this project in 2011. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about lite clients and the implication of the 2017 hard-fork. We might be in the middle of two forks at the moment.
So we have segwit and we are very happy about that.

Hi. My name is Greg Sanders. I will be giving a talk about segwit in bitcoin lessons learned. I will also give some takeaways that I think are important. A little bit about myself. I work on Elements Project at Blockstream. I was a reviewer on segwit for Bitcoin Core. How do we scale protocol development? How do we scale review and keep things safe?
Segwit started as an element in elements alpha.</description></item><item><title>Bloxroute</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</guid><description>bloXroute: A network for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s blockchain
Introduction Hi. I am Souyma and I am here to talk with you about Bloxroute. The elephant in the room is that blockchains have been claimed to solve everything like credit cards, social media, and global micropayments. To handle credit card payment volumes, blockchains need like 5000 transactions per second, for microtransactions you need 70000 transactions per second, and for social media even more. Blockchains today do about 10 transactions/second.</description></item><item><title>Segregated Witness And Its Impact On Scalability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/segregated-witness-and-its-impact-on-scalability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/segregated-witness-and-its-impact-on-scalability/</guid><description>slides: https://prezi.com/lyghixkrguao/segregated-witness-and-deploying-it-for-bitcoin/

Segregated witness (segwit) and deploying it for Bitcoin
Okay. So I am Pieter Wuille. I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about segregated witness for Bitcoin. Before I can explain this, I want to give some context. We all know how bitcoin transactions work. Every bitcoin transaction gets inputs, which refer to previous outputs being spent. Every input has the txid and the signature to prove that it is allowed, plus an amount and script in every output.</description></item></channel></rss>
