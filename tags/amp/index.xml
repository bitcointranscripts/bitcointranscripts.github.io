Intro We will start with gory technical details about routing and pathfinding. I hope I will be able to keep you awake for the next twenty minutes. I’m working for ACINQ on the Lightning Network. If you don’t know ACINQ we are contributors to the specification. We run the biggest node on the network and we are also one of the leading mobile wallets, eclair-mobile.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Overview</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/lightning-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/lightning-overview/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1005913055333675009

Introduction First I am going to give a brief overview of how lightning works for those of who you may not be so familiar. Then I am going to discuss three technologies we&amp;rsquo;ll be working on in the next year at Lightning Labs and pushing forward.
