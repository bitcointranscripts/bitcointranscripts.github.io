Colloquially known as &amp;ldquo;bridges&amp;rdquo;, these mechanisms offer a diverse range of security and usability properties for users to choose from depending on their risk tolerance and cost preferences. This talk will give an overview of the different types of BTC bridges that exist, how they work, and how they can be improved.</description></item><item><title>Blind statechains: UTXO transfer with a blind signing server</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-statechains/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-statechains/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136992734953299970

Introduction I am going to talk casually through the whole statechains thing. If you want to interject, please do. I&amp;rsquo;ll get started. The current idea is to make it completely blind. It&amp;rsquo;s blinded statechains. The goal is to allow people to transfer a UTXO without changing anything on-chain. The concept I use to describe it is a blind signing server.</description></item><item><title>Statechains: Off-chain transfer of UTXOs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/statechains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/statechains/</guid><description>I am the education director of readingbitcoin.org, and I am going to be talking about statechains for off-chain transfer of UTXOs.

Statechains This is another layer 2 scaling solution, by avoiding on-chain transactions. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to lightning network. The difference is that coin movement is not restricted. You deon&amp;rsquo;t have these channels where you have to have a path and send an exact amount. There&amp;rsquo;s some synergy with lightning; it&amp;rsquo;s not a replacement for lightning.</description></item></channel></rss>
