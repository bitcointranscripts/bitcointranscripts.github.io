Introduction I am Sjors, I am going to show you how to use, you probably shouldn’t try this at home, the Bitcoin Core wallet directly with a hardware wallet. Most of that work is done by Andrew Chow. I’m just showing how it works. I will have some thoughts of my own on how that could be made more user friendly.</description></item><item><title>Assumeutxo (2019-06-07)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</guid><description>Assumeutxo

Why assumeutxo assumeutxo is a spiritual continuation of assumevalid. Why do we want to do this in the first place? At the moment, it takes hours and days to do initial block download. Various projects in the community have been implementing meassures to speed this up. Casa I think bundles datadir with their nodes. Other projects like btcpay have various ways of bundling this up and signing things with gpg keys and these solutions are not quite half-baked but they are probably not desirable either.</description></item><item><title>Carl Dong - libbitcoinkernel (2022-04-12)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/2022-04-12-carl-dong-libbitcoinkernel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/2022-04-12-carl-dong-libbitcoinkernel/</guid><description>Name: Carl Dong

Intro Hi everyone. I’m Carl Dong from Chaincode Labs and I’m here to talk about libbitcoinkernel, a project I’ve been working on that aims to extract Bitcoin Core’s consensus engine. When we download and run Bitcoin Core it is nicely packaged into a single bundle, a single application.</description></item><item><title>Fabian Jahr - Debugging Workshop (2020-02-07)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-fabian-jahr-debugging-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-fabian-jahr-debugging-workshop/</guid><description>Name: Fabian Jahr

libsecp256k1 testing Today OpenSSL de-embargoed CVE-2014-3570 &amp;ldquo;Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results&amp;rdquo;. That particular security advisory is not a concern for Bitcoin users, but it allows me to explain some of the context behind a slightly cryptic statement I made in the release notes for the upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.10: “we have reason to believe that libsecp256k1 is better tested and more thoroughly reviewed than the implementation in OpenSSL”.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - OpenSSL bug discovery (2015–01-08)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-01-08-openssl-bug/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-01-08-openssl-bug/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

OpenSSL bug discovery I contributed to the discovery and analysis of CVE-2014-3570 &amp;ldquo;Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results&amp;rdquo;. In this case, the issue was that one of the carry propagation conditions was missed. The bug was discovered as part of the development of libsecp256k1, a high performance (and hopefully high quality: correct, complete, side-channel resistant) implementation of the cryptographic operators used by Bitcoin, developed primarily by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille along with a number of other people.</description></item><item><title>Jeremy Rubin - Bitcoin Core (2018-04-23)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2018-04-23-jeremy-rubin-bitcoin-core/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2018-04-23-jeremy-rubin-bitcoin-core/</guid><description>Jeremy Rubin

Intro Thank you very much for the warm welcome. So welcome to the hard core workout. It is not going to be that difficult but you can stretch if you need to. It is going to be a lot of material so I’m going to go a little bit fast. If you have any questions feel free to stop me in the middle.</description></item><item><title>John Newbery - Wallet Development (2019-06-19)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-19-john-newbery-wallet-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-19-john-newbery-wallet-development/</guid><description>Name: John Newbery

Kind of boring right?

I&amp;rsquo;ll be the contrarian - I think academia is awful and should be destroyed.
Reputation is completely independent of content and should not be the mechanism by which you judge the quality of research; your reputation is worthless to me. (laughter)
My perspective: [first, slidemaker&amp;rsquo;s regret! might have reorganized this]
I&amp;rsquo;m a bitcoin core developer. Also worked at LedgerX (4 years). I also work on biotech on the hobbyist side, garage engineering &amp;ndash; what I was doing when bitcoin was launched.</description></item><item><title>Overview Bitcoin Core Architecture</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/overview-bitcoin-core-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/overview-bitcoin-core-architecture/</guid><description>Bitcoin Core architecture overview

Hi, my name is Bryan, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about SIGHASH NOINPUT. It was something that I was asked to speak about. It is currently not deployed, but it is an active proposal.
So, just really brief about who I am. I have a software development background. I just left LedgerX last week, so that is an exciting change in my life.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar - AssumeUTXO (2021-11-02)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2021-11-02-socratic-seminar-assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2021-11-02-socratic-seminar-assumeutxo/</guid><description>Name: Socratic Seminar

Bitcoin Core wallet architecture + descriptors
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136282460675878915
writeup: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16165
Wallet architecture discussion There are three main areas here. One is IsMine: how do I determine a particular output is affecting my wallet? What about asking for a new address, where is it coming from? That&amp;rsquo;s not just get new address, it&amp;rsquo;s get raw change address, it&amp;rsquo;s also change being created in fundrawtransaction. The third issue is wallet signing. Storage is not an entrypoint, it&amp;rsquo;s just a way of implementing these things.</description></item><item><title>Wallet Architecture in Bitcoin Core (2018-10-04)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/wallet-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/wallet-architecture/</guid><description>Bitcoin Core wallet architecture

Introduction Thanks Bryan for talking about HD wallets. I am going to be talking about wallet architecture in Bitcoin Core. Alright. Who am I? I work on Bitcoin Core. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code on Bitcoin Core for about 3 years. Lately I have been working on the wallet. I work for Chaincode Labs which is why I get to work on Bitcoin Core. We are a small research lab in New York.</description></item></channel></rss>
