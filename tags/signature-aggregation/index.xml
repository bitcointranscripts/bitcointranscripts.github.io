TODOs but also no use cases upcoming so adding it to the BIP repo doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem useful
BIP Half-agg TODOs for BIP
Consider setting z_0 = 1
Reconsider maximum number of signatures
Add failing verification test vectors that exercise edge cases.
Add signing test vectors (passing and failing, including edge cases)
Test latest version of hacspec (run through checker)
Half-agg BIP has a max number of signatures (2^16), making testing easy</description></item><item><title>Bellare-Neven</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-05-bellare-neven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-05-bellare-neven/</guid><description>See also http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation/
It&amp;rsquo;s been published, it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a decade, and it&amp;rsquo;s widely cited. In Bellare-Neven, it&amp;rsquo;s itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a multi-signature scheme which means multiple pubkeys and one message. You should treat the individual authorizations to spend inputs, as individual messages. What we need is an interactive aggregate signature scheme. Bellare-Neven&amp;rsquo;s paper suggests a trivial way of building an aggregate signature scheme out of a multisig scheme where interactively everyone signs everyone&amp;rsquo;s message.</description></item><item><title>Signature Aggregation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/907065194463072258
Sipa, can you sign and verify ECDSA signatures by hand? No. Over GF(43), maybe. Inverses could take a little bit to compute. Over GF(2).
I think the first thing we should talk about is some definitions. I&amp;rsquo;d like to start by distinguishing between three things: Key aggregation, signature aggregation, and batch validation. Multi-signature later.
There are three different problems. Key aggregation is where there are a number of people with each their own key, they want to produce a combined key that can only sign when they come together.</description></item></channel></rss>
