Introduction This will be a technical talk. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re prepared for some cryptography. By the way, this now has a bip number as of this morning. This is bip324. I call it v2 message transport protocol. It&amp;rsquo;s not a consensus change, it&amp;rsquo;s purely a p2p network layer change. It&amp;rsquo;s not all about encryption, but mainly about encryption.</description></item><item><title>BIP151: Peer-to-Peer Encryption and Authentication from the Perspective of End-User</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/bip151-peer-encryption/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/bip151-peer-encryption/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/785046960705339392
Good morning. Thanks for having me here. I would like to talk about the end-user perspective of p2p authentication. I would like to start with a little example of how difficult it is to be aware of end-user issues that they are facing at the front. Who is using a thin client? An &amp;ldquo;SPV&amp;rdquo; wallet on your smartphone? Yeah. Who of you are on iOS? Yeah iOS has a pretty large market share, maybe not in this room.</description></item></channel></rss>
