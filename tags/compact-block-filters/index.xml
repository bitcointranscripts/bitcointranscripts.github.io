Introduction My name is Laolu or Roasbeef on the internet. I’m going to talk about light clients in general and then also what we’re working on in terms of light clients and then also how that factors into the lightning network itself. The talk is called Neutrino because that is the name of our new light client that has been released. There has been a BIP proposal and I’ll go through all of that in the talk itself.</description></item><item><title>Neutrino, Good and Bad</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/neutrino/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/neutrino/</guid><description>&amp;hellip; 228C D70C FAA6 17E3 2679 E455

In order to talk about it, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about before Neutrino.</description></item></channel></rss>
