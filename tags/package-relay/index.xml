Ancestor Package Relay BIP BIP updated to be receiver-initiated ancestor packages only. Sender-initiated vs receiver-initiated package relay. Receiver-intiated package relay enables a node to ask for more information when they suspect they are missing something (i.e. to resolve orphans). Sender-initiated package relay should, theoretically, save a round trip by notifying the receiver ahead of time that &amp;ldquo;hey, this is going to be a package, so make sure you download and submit these transactions together.</description></item></channel></rss>
