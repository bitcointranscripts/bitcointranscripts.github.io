https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1229838162827993088
Introduction Hi, good morning everyone. I am a Japanese financial regulator at JFSA. My goal is to promote financial innovations and still ensure the financial stability and various regulatory goals. I have nearly 10 years experience as a regulator. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a strong background in technology, so I hope I can rely on the other stakeholders on this. I am now in Washington DC doing research on blockchain and governance policy.</description></item><item><title>Technological Stability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coordination-of-decentralized-finance-workshop/2020-stanford/technological-stability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coordination-of-decentralized-finance-workshop/2020-stanford/technological-stability/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1229891596688052226
Controversial thesis: the primary source of economic instability is unreasonable demands (from regulators, but really from the general public) for violating certain cryptocurrency tech design principles, like on sound money- privacy and confidentiality (like confidential transactions and confidential assets), monetary policy (like scarcity economics), identity vs anonymity, AML/KYC requirements, censorship, sanctions requirements and discrimination (e.g. denying money to certain parties), and issues of fungibility (like mixing and history-indistinguishability).
Financial stability goals- like avoiding global economic crashes- might be at odds with goals like producing sound money and privacy for everyone.</description></item><item><title>Custody Working Group</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/custody-group/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/custody-group/</guid><description>One of the problems in the ecosystem was nomenclature. We started working on a report about what features a nomenclature would have. Airgaps, constant-time software, sidechannel resistance, Faraday cage, deterministic software, entropy, blind signatures, proof-of-reserve, multi-vendor hardware to minimize compromise. Multi-location and multi-sig. Insurance guarantee scheme. Canaries, dead man switches, tripwires, heartbeat mechanisms. Shamir&amp;rsquo;s secret sharing vs multisig. The second part of this report was going to be market analysis. Most companies don&amp;rsquo;t advertise what their custodial process really is.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Custody</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/bitcoin-custody/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/bitcoin-custody/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1048014038179823617
Start time: 6:09:50
My name is Bryan Bishop, I’m going to be talking about bitcoin custody. Here is my PGP fingerprint, we should be doing that. So who am I, I have a software development background, I don’t just type transcripts. I’m actually no longer at LedgerX as of Friday (Sept 21 2018) when I came here. That is the end of 4 years, so you are looking at a free man.</description></item><item><title>NY DFS Bitlicense Lawsky Update</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/nydfs-bitlicense-lawsky-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/nydfs-bitlicense-lawsky-update/</guid><description>NY DFS BitLicense update 2014-12-18

And that&amp;rsquo;s a serious problem that we all need to address with a hightened sense of urgency and focus. Let me start with the BitLicense and virtual currencies. These came on our radar screen last year at DFS because like all of the other states we regulate money transmitters like Moneygram and Western Union. We were worried that virtual currency firms were transmitting currency. Our regulatory rules were written before the internet and before virtual currencies.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Regulation Landscape</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/bitcoin-regulation-landscape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/bitcoin-regulation-landscape/</guid><description>Elizabeth Stark Jerry Brito Constance Choi Christian Catalini (moderator) MIT Compton Labs - Building 26, room 100

Okay guys, we are getting close to the time for the next panel. Head back to your seats. You may bring food in with you. We also started 15 minutes late. People have 15 minutes .. we ended lunch on time. One of our speakers literally only came for 30 minutes today, 2 to 230.</description></item><item><title>Compliance And Confidentiality</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/compliance-and-confidentiality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/compliance-and-confidentiality/</guid><description>Compliance and confidentiality: can they co-exist?
Alexander Zaidelson, Beam
Introduction Hi everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s a great pleasure to be here. I&amp;rsquo;m Alexander Zaidelson, CEO of Beam. I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting our view on the regulation and how we live with it as a project. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert in regulation. Whatever I&amp;rsquo;m showing here is how we see the landscape from what we understand.
Beam is a confidential transaction. The question is, how can confidential cryptocurrency co-exist with regulation?</description></item><item><title>Delaware Initiative</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/marco-santori-delaware-initiative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/marco-santori-delaware-initiative/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

Delaware initiative
It&amp;rsquo;s good to see so many friendly audiences in the audience. I am at Pillsbury Wintrhop Shaw Pittman. We are focusing on distinct areas of law as it applies to blockchain tech. We have been in the space as early as 2011 so we were trying to do the land grab. My team has been asked by the State of Delaware to serve as legal ambassadors to the blockchain industry.</description></item><item><title>Future Of Regulation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-regulation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-regulation/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

JB: I want to start with Giancarlo. Your approach has been &amp;ldquo;first do no harm&amp;rdquo;. What opportunity is this?
Giancarlo: There are a number of elements to my interest. I want to go back to a moment of time where it became clear tome that something like this, although I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it would be this, was tremendously necessary.</description></item><item><title>G20 Discussion</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/g20-discussion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/g20-discussion/</guid><description>Why do we need a multi-stakeholder discussion in a blockchain world?

Major goals for financial regulators The primary goals of financial regulators are to maintain financial stability, protect investors and consumers, and prevent financial crimes. These goals are public interests and are needed to be achieved regardless of the technology used in the financial systems.</description></item><item><title>Perspective</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/perspective/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/decentralized-financial-architecture-workshop/perspective/</guid><description>Regulators should focus on consumer protection
Regulators should focus on operating (or overseeing) rating agencies, and formal review of proposed standards
Fungibility is important, and many regulatory goals are contrary to fungibility, indicating that their forms of money will be inferior and their economy will be left behind.
Anonymity should be a core value&amp;ndash; the society with the most privacy will have the most advantages.
The importance of regulatory sandboxes (which should be optional).</description></item><item><title>Security And Usability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/security-and-usability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/security-and-usability/</guid><description>Melanie Shapiro Alan Reiner Kristov Atlas Elizabeth Stark (moderator) and maybe Melanie Shapiro? malani?
