The initial idea is shipping a map file every Core release. Fabian wrote an article about how would be integrated into the deployment (https://gist.github.com/fjahr/f879769228f4f1c49b49d348f80d7635). Some devs pointed out an option would be to have it separated to the release process, any regular contributor could update it whenever they like (who would do it? frequency?). Then when the release comes around one of the recent ones will be chosen.</description></item></channel></rss>
