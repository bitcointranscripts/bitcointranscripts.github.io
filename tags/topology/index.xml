Lightning topology limitation Stephan: Christian, welcome to the show. I’m a big fan of your work.
Christian: Thank you so much for having me Stephan. I am a long time listener and I am happy to be joining you today.
Stephan: There has been a lot of chatter in the Bitcoin community on what might happen in the future.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Topological Analysis</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-topological-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-topological-analysis/</guid><description>Topological analysis of the lightning network

Introduction Knowing the topology is not necessarily a vulnerability, but it gives you a lot of information. If I know Bryan&amp;rsquo;s full node is connected to some other nodes, I will have an easier time to cut Bryan out of the network or launch attacks against him. Knowing the topology is not necessarily a vulnerability, but it&amp;rsquo;s really strong information.</description></item><item><title>Lightning network topology, its creation and maintenance</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/lightning-network-topology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/lightning-network-topology/</guid><description>Carla Kirk-Cohen

Introduction Alright. Give me a second to test this. Alright. Antoine has taken you through the routing layer. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take you through what the lightning network looks like today. This is the current topology of the network and how this came about, and some approaches for maintaining the network and making the graph look like we want it to look.
Lightning brief overview There&amp;rsquo;s ideally only two transactions involved in any lightning channel, the commitment transaction and the closure transaction.</description></item><item><title>Txprobe</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/txprobe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/txprobe/</guid><description>TxProbe: Discovering bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s network topology using orphan transactions

Introduction I am Sergi. I will be presenting txprobe. This is baout discovering the topology of the bitcoin network using orphan transactions. There are a bunch of coauthors and collaborators.
What we know about the topology I want to start by talking a little bit about what we know about the network topology without using txprobe.</description></item></channel></rss>
