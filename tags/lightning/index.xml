Speaker 0: Are we on the pathfinding one or did we pass that?
Speaker 1: I think [redacted] should be attending because they added their new gossip status thing to the agenda. I think they should join soon, but we can start with the verification, where I think it just needs more review to clarify some needs. But apart from that, it looks good to me. 1182. That&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing we want to get in quickly because otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s just a mess to rebase everything on top.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1183</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-07-15-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-07-15-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1183
Speaker 0: How do you do MPP by the way? For example, you have two blinded paths. You don&amp;rsquo;t even split inside the path.
Speaker 1: We won&amp;rsquo;t MPP. Our new routing rewrite — which is on the back burner while I sort all this out — should be able to MPP across because they give you the capacity. In theory, we could do that. In practice, if you need MPP, we&amp;rsquo;re out.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1161</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-05-06-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-05-06-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1161
Speaker 0: So the next one is go see 12-blocks delay channel closed follow-up. So, this is something we already merged something to a spec, saying that whenever you see a channel being spent on-chain, you should wait for 12 blocks to allow splicing to happen. It&amp;rsquo;s just one line that was missing in the requirement, and then they found it in the older splicing PR. So, there&amp;rsquo;s already three ACKs.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - 1155</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-04-22-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-04-22-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1155
Speaker 0: Cool. Okay. They have four or five things that I think are all in line with what we have already as well. First one is the spec-clean up. Last thing we did, I think we reverted one of the gossip changes, and that is going to be in LND 18. Basically, making the feature bits to be required over time. After that, is anything blocking this? I need to catch up with PR a little bit.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - 1152</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-04-08-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-04-08-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1152
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did a point release to undo it as well. What I&amp;rsquo;d like to do is to write up the spec changes to basically say: Yeah, don&amp;rsquo;t set the bit if you don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to say — rather than if you don&amp;rsquo;t support it. Yes, my sweep through the network to go: Hey, there&amp;rsquo;s only a few nodes that don&amp;rsquo;t set this. Missed LDK nodes obviously.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1150</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-03-25-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-03-25-specification-call/</guid><description>NOTE: There were some issues with the recording of this call, resulting in a partial transcript.
Speaker 0: If you&amp;rsquo;re only connected to a single peer, it makes sense not to tell them that you speak gossip, right? Because you won&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to say, and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to — with our current state of gossip queries, they might think they&amp;rsquo;re probing randomly and happen to hit nodes that don&amp;rsquo;t know anything, and fall into a bad state.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1146</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-03-11-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-03-11-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1146
Speaker 0: So first item, I just wanted to highlight that I opened the PR for zero reserve, if you want to look at it. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if people are actually trying to implement that. It matches the implementation that we have currently in Eclair and Phoenix, but with a different feature bit. So if someone else is implementing that, they can just have a look at the PR, and we can work on the interop whenever someone is ready.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1142</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-02-26-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2024-02-26-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1142
Speaker 0: [redacted] said they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to attend, but they’ve nicely created an agenda for us as usual. So I can take a look and run through the list. First up, so I think this has sort of went back and forth a few times. This is the very long-lived request to just have a zero value in reserve basically, like a first class type. [redacted] made this PR, so it&amp;rsquo;s spec PR 1140.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1127</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/lightning-2024-01-15-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/lightning-2024-01-15-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1127
Speaker 0: First of all, it looks like we still have a mailing list. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much we can rely on that. But, in the meanwhile, nobody has sent any email on the mailing list. I guess we should be migrating to Delving Bitcoin for now. Has someone experimented with running a discourse instance somewhere else? I think it was [redacted] who was supposed to do that.</description></item><item><title>Vortex: ZeroLink for Lightning Opens</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/onchain-privacy/vortex-zerolink-for-lightning-opens/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/onchain-privacy/vortex-zerolink-for-lightning-opens/</guid><description>(The start of the talk is missing from the source media)
What is a blind signature All these people could come, and they all can then present their signatures.

Speaker 0: We won&amp;rsquo;t have posting for the mailing list anymore in one month and a half, so we should probably do something. My plan was to just wait to see what bitcoin-dev would do and do the same thing. Does someone have opinions on that or an idea on what we should do?
Speaker 1: Who&amp;rsquo;s managing the email account for the lightning-dev mailing list? You, [Redacted]?</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1116</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-11-06-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-11-06-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1116
Speaker 0: I moved the first item on the to-do list today, dual funding, because we finally have interop between C-Lightning and Eclair. We were only missing the reestablished part, and everything was mostly okay from the beginning. It looks like the spec seems to be clear enough because we both understood it the same way. So now, we really have full interop on master, and I guess this should go in a release with experimental flags for CLN.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1115</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-10-23-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-10-23-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1115
Speaker 0: Alright. So, I guess the first item is something that has already been ACKed and is only one clarification. But I had one question on the PR. I was wondering, [redacted], for which feature you actually use that code because neither LND or Eclair handles — we just disconnect on anything mandatory that we haven&amp;rsquo;t set. Where are you actually using that or how are you planning on using it?</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1114</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-09-25-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-09-25-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1114
Speaker 0: So, [redacted] pointed out that we did not do this, and we have to do this. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the code so that you have to push their commitment transaction. Now, there are several problems with this. One is that in many states, there are two possible commitment transactions they could have. In theory, you know what they are. In practice, it turned out to be a bit of a nightmare to unwind the state.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1103</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-08-28-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-08-28-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1103
Speaker 0: I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen any discussion happening on any of the PRs. So, I don&amp;rsquo;t think we should go and have them in order, except maybe the first one that we may want to just finalize and get something into the spec to say that it should be 2016 everywhere. But, as [redacted] was saying, can probably make it a one-liner and it would be easier.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1101</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-08-14-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-08-14-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1101
Speaker 0: Alright, should we start? I want to talk a quick update on dual funding because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with [redacted] on cross-compatibility tests between Core Lightning and Eclair, and so far, everything looks good. The only part that has not yet been fully implemented in CLN is the reconnection part — when you disconnect in the middle of the signature exchange. This kind of reconnection is supposed to complete that signature exchange with one new TLV added to channel re-establish.</description></item><item><title>Privacy and robustness in Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/privacy-and-robustness-in-lightning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/privacy-and-robustness-in-lightning/</guid><description>In this technical discussion, Rusty Russell, Mark Erhardt, and Adam Jonas delve into the intricacies of the Lightning Network (LN) after eight years of development. They emphasize the importance of simplicity and robustness in the protocol, noting how attempts to increase fairness often complicate the system. Russell highlights the ongoing need for improvements in privacy and robustness, pointing out that while these areas aren&amp;rsquo;t usually urgent, they are crucial for long-term stability. They discuss the LN symmetry (formerly Eltoo) proposal, which aims to simplify the protocol by eliminating penalties for unintentional errors, thus making the network easier to maintain. The conversation also touches on the challenges posed by recent fee spikes and the need for better fee management and protocol upgrades. They conclude by acknowledging the significant progress made and the continuous efforts required to keep improving the network</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1098</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-07-31-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-07-31-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1098
Speaker 0: Great. I guess, does anyone have any urgent stuff that we want to make sure we get to in the meeting today? If not, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to go ahead and start working down the recently updated proposal seeking review list. Great. Okay. First up on the list is option simple close. This is from the summit we had a few weeks ago in July. Looks like [Redacted] and [Redacted] have commented on this and [Redacted] stuff.</description></item><item><title>Lightning on Taproot</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/lightning-on-taproot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/lightning-on-taproot/</guid><description>My name is Arik.

Speaker 0: Alright. Does anyone want to volunteer to take us through the list? Nope? Okay. I will read the issue that [Redacted] very kindly left for us then. The first item on the list is Bolt 8’s chaining keys clarification. Is there anything we need to talk about here?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s almost under the spelling rule, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s been ACKed by everyone. So, unless people have objections to the specific wording.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1088</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-06-19-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-06-19-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1088
Speaker 0: Thanks [Redacted]. So, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much that has changed on any of the PRs that are on the pending to-do list, except for attributable errors. So, maybe since [Redacted] is here, we can start with attributable errors, and [Redacted], you can tell us what has changed about the HMAC truncation, for example.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so not that much changed. Just the realization that we could truncate the HMAC basically, because the failure message was so large already.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1085</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-06-05-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-06-05-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1085
Speaker 0: Alright, so let&amp;rsquo;s start. So, the first PR on the list is one we&amp;rsquo;ve already discussed last week. It just needs someone from another team, either Lightning Labs or LDK to hack. It&amp;rsquo;s just a clarification on Bolt 8. So, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should be reviewed right now because just takes time to work through it and verify that it matches your implementation. But if someone on either of those teams can add it to their to-do list, hack it, and then we can merge it.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1082</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-05-22-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-05-22-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1082
Speaker 1: So, the first PR we have on the list is a clarification on Bolt 8 by [Redacted]. It looks like, if I understand correctly, someone tried to reimplement Bolt 8 and got it wrong, and it&amp;rsquo;s only clarifications. Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes. So LN message - a JavaScript library that speaks to nodes - had everything right except for the fact they shared a chaining key, which is correct to start with.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1076</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-05-08-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-05-08-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1076
Speaker 0: First off of the list is dual funding. [Redacted] has merged the two small patches that we had discussed adding. There&amp;rsquo;s only one small patch that is remaining, which is about making the TLV signed to allow for future splicing to make sure that splicing can also use the RBF messages for signed amounts. But apart from that, it looks like dual funding is almost complete. We plan on activating it on our node soon to be able to use it in Phoenix.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Specification Meeting - Agenda 1067</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-04-24-specification-call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification/2023-04-24-specification-call/</guid><description>Agenda: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/issues/1067
Speaker 0: Alright, so first thing I&amp;rsquo;ve got on deck is 1066, which says: Correct final CLTV handling and blinded paths.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven&amp;rsquo;t dug as deep into the blinded path stuff, so this may be an incorrect reading that I was confused to. Basically, for a blinded path, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a final CLTV for the recipient because we just have a full CLTV delta for the full blinded path.</description></item><item><title>Lightning History and everything else</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-history-and-everything-else/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-history-and-everything-else/</guid><description>Tadge Dryja chats with us about writing the Lightning Network paper and working in the Bitcoin space.</description></item><item><title>Let's Talk About Dual Funding: Protocol Overview</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/lets-talk-about-dual-funding-protocol-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/lets-talk-about-dual-funding-protocol-overview/</guid><description>Openning a Lightning Channel Unspent transaction output is locked up.

This is how you can become Signet-rich.
First, we should probably do an overview of the various network types. Everybody knows about Mainnet. This is what we use day to day, but there&amp;rsquo;s a few other testing networks. RegTest, or SimNet, if you are running BTCD, is a local unit testing framework.</description></item><item><title>Lightning updates / Stratum V2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-updates-stratum-v2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-updates-stratum-v2/</guid><description>Murch: 00:00:00

Rene Pickhardt and Lisa Neigut shared their insights, highlighting Lightning&amp;rsquo;s potential as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and a future payment infrastructure. They emphasized its efficiency for frequent transactions between trusted parties but noted challenges in its current infrastructure, such as the need for continuous online operation and the risk of losing funds if a node is compromised. The panelists discussed the scalability of the network, indicating that while millions could use it self-sovereignly, larger-scale adoption would likely involve centralized service providers. The conversation also touched on the impact of Taproot on privacy and channel efficiency, and the technical intricacies of maintaining state and preventing fraud within the network.</description></item><item><title>Minisketch and Lightning gossip</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/2022/2022-06-07-alex-myers-minisketch-lightning-gossip/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/2022/2022-06-07-alex-myers-minisketch-lightning-gossip/</guid><description>Location: Bitcoin++

Bitcoin Core funding a transaction without looking at ancestors I have something that I wanted to ask of our implementers who implemented a wallet.

Introduction Matteo got sick and couldn&amp;rsquo;t come. His coauthors couldn&amp;rsquo;t come either. So a talk was pre-recorded and will be played now. Our work is about realizing atomic multi-channel updates with constant collateral in bitcoin.
Scalability issues We all know that blockchains have scalability issues. Public verifiability means we have to store each transaction on the blockchain. The transaction rate of bitcoin is far from being satisfactory. We can reach up to about 10 transactions/second in bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>A Schnorr-Taproot’ed Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-antoine-riard-taproot-lightning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-antoine-riard-taproot-lightning/</guid><description>Slides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9vs54e9bqf317u0/Schnorr-Taproot%27ed-LN.pdf

Lightning architecture The Lightning architecture for those who are not familiar with it. You have the blockchain as the underlying layer. On top of it you are going to build a channel, you have a HTLC and people are going to spend onions to you.

Introduction I am going ot talk about anonymous atomic locks for scalability and interoperability in payment-channel hubs. This is joint work with my colleagues.
Scalability I will try to keep this section as short as possible. This talk is also about scalability in bitcoin. You&amp;rsquo;re probably aware of the scalability issues. There is decentralized data structure recording each transaction in order to provide public verifiability. Global consensus is required, such that everyone checks the whole blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Atomic Multi-Channel Updates with Constant Collateral in Bitcoin-Compatible Payment-Channel Networks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/atomic-multi-channel-updates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/atomic-multi-channel-updates/</guid><description>paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/583

Introduction Thank you for coming to my talk after lunch. This talk today is about atomic multi-channel updates with constant collateral in bitcoin-compatible payment-channel networks. It&amp;rsquo;s a long title, but I hope you will understand. This is collaborative work with my colleagues.
Scalability We&amp;rsquo;re at Scaling Bitcoin so you&amp;rsquo;re probably not suprised that I think bitcoin has scaling issues. It&amp;rsquo;s a decentralized data structure called blockchain where we store every transaction that happens.</description></item><item><title>Recovering Payment Channel Midstates Using only The User's Seed</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/payment-channel-recovery-with-seeds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/payment-channel-recovery-with-seeds/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1172129077765050368
Introduction Cool. This addresses the lightning network which is a scaling technique for the bitcoin network. A big challenge with the lightning network is that you have these midstates that you need to keep. If you lose them, you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck with your counterparty. We had a lot of talks this morning about how to recover midstates but a lot of them used watchtowers. However, this proposal does not require a watchtower and you can restore midstates knowing nothing but your wallet seed.</description></item><item><title>A walk through the layers of Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-layer-by-layer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-layer-by-layer/</guid><description>Introduction Good afternoon everyone.

Introduction The limitations it&amp;rsquo;s uh you have to fight when you want to build lightweight clients mobile clients so this again, this is how mobile clients work, you scan payment requests, you have a view of the network that is supposed to be good enough, you compute the routes, you get an HTLC, you get a preimage back you&amp;rsquo;ve paid.
So a Lightning node is a Bitcoin node, as in, you have to be able to create, sign, and send Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network.</description></item><item><title>Path Finding in the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-path-finding-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-path-finding-lightning-network/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Residency 2019
Introduction Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk a little bit about path finding on the Lightning Network and some part of it will be about the gossip protocol which is like a little bit of a review of what the gossip messages are going to look like. So it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit basic again. But other than that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that you seek more for like opinionated talks and recent ideas instead of, like, how the bolts work because you already know all of that.</description></item><item><title>Splicing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-splicing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-splicing/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Transcript by: Caralie Chrisco
Introduction So splicing basically means you have a payment channel, you have a certain capacity of a payment channel and you want to change the capacity on the payment channel. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to change your balance right? For balance change,(inaudible) we&amp;rsquo;ll get some money on it. But splicing really means you want to change the capacity.
I mean the obvious way of doing this is close the channel, make a new channel with the design capacity and you could.</description></item><item><title>The Update Layer</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-update-layer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-update-layer/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Introduction Maybe we had a wrong impression, you can ask, like in Christian’s talk, as many questions as you want while the presentation is there. So, it&amp;rsquo;s a small disclaimer just saying: these slides are part of a much larger slide set which is open-source and you find notes and, I think, we share slides in the Google Docs anyway.
The outline of the talk is, I’m going to talk about the construction of payment channels in Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Attack Vectors of Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-attack-vectors-of-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-attack-vectors-of-lightning-network/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Residency – Summer 2019
Introduction All right so I&amp;rsquo;m going to introduce really quickly attack vectors on Lightning. I focus on first what you can do with the Lightning protocol, but I will mostly speak about how attacks will probably happen in real life. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not going to be direct attacks on the protocol itself.
Denial of Service So the basic attacks you can have when you&amp;rsquo;re running lightning nodes are denial of service attacks basically.</description></item><item><title>Eltoo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</guid><description>Eltoo: The (Far) Future of Lightning

Intro Who has never heard about eltoo? It is my pet project and I am pretty proud of it. I will try to keep this short. I was told that you all have seen my presentation about the evolution of update protocols. I will probably go pretty quickly. I still want to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions if they have any.</description></item><item><title>Onion Routing Deep Dive</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Residency – Summer 2019
Intro We&amp;rsquo;ve not seen exactly why we are using an onion, or why we chose this construction of an onion and how this construction of an onion actually looks like. So my goal right now is to basically walk you through the iterations that onion routing packets have done so far, and why we chose this construction we have here.
So, just to be funny, I have once again the difference between distance vector routing, which is IP-based routing, basically, where we just have the recipient’s address, and source-based routing, where we have a list of intermediates, in which we can then finally reach our destination.</description></item><item><title>Routing Failures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-routing-failures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-routing-failures/</guid><description>Introduction So I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about routing failures in lightning. Basically lightning is a network of payment channels and you can pay anyone, you can find a route. In routing in lightning you have two completely different concepts: how to find a route (path finding) and once you have a route how to actually send a payment through the routes to the final destination. This is what Christian showed that&amp;rsquo;s the source routing.</description></item><item><title>Base and Transport Layers of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-base-and-transport-layers-of-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-base-and-transport-layers-of-lightning-network/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019

Introduction Fabrice: The base and transport layer, almost everything was already introduced this morning so it&amp;rsquo;s going to be very quick. So have you visited the lightning repo on GitHub? Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t?
Okay, good. So you&amp;rsquo;ve seen all this? That was a test.
We&amp;rsquo;ve covered almost everything this morning. I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna get back to the base protocol, BOLT 8 and maybe BOLT 9 because I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s been mentioned a lot.</description></item><item><title>Multihop of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-rene-pickhardt-multihop-in-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-rene-pickhardt-multihop-in-lightning/</guid><description>Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/lightning/Multihop_Layer.pdf
Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about Lightning Network payment channels and the update layer which is basically multihop payments and the outline of this talk is one slide myths about routing that are floating around and I just want to discuss them in the beginning very briefly. Then I will talk about the payment process on the Lightning Network and compare it a little bit with the payment process on Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Payments</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/lightning-payments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/lightning-payments/</guid><description>Lightning payments (and more) on the web
CL: Thank you Elizabeth and Stacy for that great talk. Who runs a lightning node here? So a lot of you. Are you guys excited about lightning? Great, we have like four more talks on lightning. Next we have Will O&amp;rsquo;Beirne who will be talking about lightning payments on the web. Big round of applause.

Introduction WP: We have a fireside chat with Stacy Herbert from Kaiser Report and Elizabeth Stark. Some people say she is the CEO of Lightning Network, but she is the CEO of Lightning Labs. Let&amp;rsquo;s invite them on stage.
SH: Did anyone notice the bitcoin price today? How many here are reckless? How many of you have used lightning?

Introduction Hi, I work at Lightning Labs. I want to talk about the dawn of hyperloop. It&amp;rsquo;s a new concept.
Hyperloop To zoom out on what problem we&amp;rsquo;re working on here, we had this cool lightning network. But it&amp;rsquo;s, the way the lightning network works, is that it&amp;rsquo;s complementary to the bitcoin network. Each side has its pros and cons. If you want the most effective way to send capital around, you want to leverage both.</description></item><item><title>Taxonomy Of Ln Nodes</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/taxonomy-of-ln-nodes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/taxonomy-of-ln-nodes/</guid><description>Introduction Hello. I work at Blockstream on c-lightning. I am here today to talk to you about a taxonomy of nodes about who&amp;rsquo;s who on the lightning network. I wnat ot go through the tools that have been built, looking through the perspectives of what different nodes are trying to accomplish.

LND 0.6 Beta Deep Dive
Intro lnd 0.6 was about seven months in the making. There’s more things that we could fit into this talk alone but I cherrypicked some of the highlights and things that will have some real world impact on users of the network or people who are using the API or just generally users of lnd. The high level impact on the network going forward and how we plan to scale up for the next 100K channels that come onto the network.</description></item><item><title>JSON Interface</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-rusty-russell-json-interface/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-rusty-russell-json-interface/</guid><description>JSON Interface with c-lightning and Writing Extensions

Intro Ok I have top running. We have a plan and we’re going to start from zero. We’re going to clone c-lightning, we’re going to compile it, we’re going to set up a test node. I’m assuming Bitcoin is already installed. We’re going to talk a little about configuring it and stuff like that. All this stuff is useful to see somebody else do.</description></item><item><title>Major Limitations of Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-alex-bosworth-major-limitations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-alex-bosworth-major-limitations/</guid><description>Slides: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UIHfYdnAWGMvsLhljTgcneCxQAHcWjxg

Intro So I had a Twitter poll to decide what to talk about. People seem pretty interested in the limitations. Where is the line of what Lightning can do and what Lightning can’t do. That’s what I want to talk about. To make it more clear what can be done and what can’t be done.

Introduction Thanks for having me. I want to talk a little bit about a project I’ve been working on for about a year called rust-lightning. I started it in December so a year and a few months ago. This is my first presentation on it so I’m excited to finally get to talk about it a little bit.

Introduction Knowing the topology is not necessarily a vulnerability, but it gives you a lot of information. If I know Bryan&amp;rsquo;s full node is connected to some other nodes, I will have an easier time to cut Bryan out of the network or launch attacks against him. Knowing the topology is not necessarily a vulnerability, but it&amp;rsquo;s really strong information.

Intro Good morning from the last day of presentations. I’m Chris still. Today I will be talking to you about c-lightning, how to develop on it, how to extend it, adapt it to your needs and how to customize it so it fits into whatever you are trying to do. Not whatever we thought you might want to do.
Goals First of all the goals of c-lightning are basically to be fast and lightweight.</description></item><item><title>Bootstrapping Lightning Node</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-elaine-ou-bootstrapping-lightning-node/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-elaine-ou-bootstrapping-lightning-node/</guid><description>Bootstrapping and maintaining a Lightning Node

Intro My name ie Elaine. I’ll talk about bootstrapping and maintaining a lightning node. Pretty much all of you have probably already set up a node so this should all be review. You guys will probably know more about this than I do.
Bootstrapping and Maintaining a Lightning Node We’ll start with an overview of how routing works just to understand what the nodes are trying to do and from there we’ll step back and look at ways of finding peers and getting incoming channels and maintaining capacity.</description></item><item><title>Building Lightning Applications</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-building-lightning-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-building-lightning-applications/</guid><description>Slides: https://lightningresidency.com/assets/presentations/Bosworth_Building_Applications.pdf

Intro Today I’m going to talk about building on lnd from the perspective of we want to have developers building on lnd. Developers, developers, developers. I just have so many slides today that let’s leave questions to the end if I have any time because I over made slides.
Design Philosophy So what is the big idea behind lnd? What are we thinking about when we’re developing lnd and what do we want lnd to be?</description></item><item><title>Channel Management</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-channel-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-channel-management/</guid><description>Slides: https://lightningresidency.com/assets/presentations/Bosworth_Channel_Management.pdf
Intro Today I’m going to talk about something a little bit different to building apps. I’m going to talk about becoming a great router. Managing your node so that your node can be routing payments and be a good citizen if you choose to have public channels.
Uptime So basically the big message overall is and I think I’ve said this before, if you have public channels you’re kind of like waving to everybody “please use these channels to do routing”.</description></item><item><title>History of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018
Introduction Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Chris, as I said like three times before, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about the history of Lightning and history of off-chain protocols or layer two, or you name it, whatever name you want. I like to call them off chain because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply a hierarchy of layers but I&amp;rsquo;ll use all three terms interchangeably anyway.
I like to have an interactive presentation so if you have any questions please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate, just ask.</description></item><item><title>Lightning ≈ Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-lightning-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-lightning-bitcoin/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018
Introduction Good morning everyone my name is Chris and I&amp;rsquo;m a bitcoiners anonymous. So my job today is basically to tell you why Lightning is Bitcoin and why it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly Bitcoin. So there&amp;rsquo;s a few fundamental differences between Bitcoin on-chain payments and Lightning. I will always call Bitcoin on-chain payments just because it&amp;rsquo;s sort of the classical way of doing it.
The differences between Bitcoin and Lightning are sometimes small, sometimes bigger.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Protocol</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-lightning-protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-lightning-protocol/</guid><description>The Lightning Protocol, an Application Design Perspective

Bitcoin Optech is trying to encourage bitcoin businesses to adopt better scaling techniques and technologies, things like batching, segwit, down the line maybe Schnorr signatures, aggregatable signatures, maybe lightning. Right now we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on things that businesses could be doing right now. Exchanges could be batching, and some aren&amp;rsquo;t. We&amp;rsquo;re talking to those companies and listening to their concerns and what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and just trying to nudge them in the right direction.</description></item><item><title>Rebalancing in the Lightning Network: Analysis and Implications</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/rebalancing-lightning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/rebalancing-lightning/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1048753406628655105
Introduction This talk is going to be about rebalancing in the lightning network. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the implications and about running a lightning node.
Financial costs In the lightning network, routing nodes will incur in financial costs by having their money locked inside channels. They can&amp;rsquo;t use that money elsewhere. They incur a financial cost to doing this activity, at least an opportunity cost. To recover this, they can charge a fee every time they route a payment.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Hop Locks for Secure, Privacy-Preserving and Interoperable Payment-Channel Networks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/multi-hop-locks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/multi-hop-locks/</guid><description>Giulio Malavolta (Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg), Pedro Moreno-Sanchez (Purdue University), Clara Schneidewind (Vienna University of Technology), Aniket Kate (Purdue University) and Matteo Maffei (Vienna University of Technology)

This is joint work with my colleagues. I promise I will talk slower than the last talk. In a multi-hop network, the security tool is a hash-time lock contract (HTLC) where the payment is conditioned on revealing the pre-image of a hash function. This is pretty much the main setup for the lightning network today.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Overview, Channel Factories, Discreet Log Contracts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/lightning-network/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1048039589837852672
Introduction I have quite a while to speak. I hope it&amp;rsquo;s not too boring. I&amp;rsquo;ll have an intermission half way through. It&amp;rsquo;s not going to be two hours. It will be more like 80 minutes or something. We are going to talk about payment channels, unidirectional payment channels, lightning channels, homomorphic keys, hash trees, watchtowers, discreet log contracts, oracles, anticipated signatures, DLCS within channels, etc.

Mechanisms The first thing to think about is that we have two different mechanisms for making Bitcoin and lightning work. One mechanism is math — If you do a SHA 256 of something you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about incentives, whether that&amp;rsquo;s going to match to the expected result. There&amp;rsquo;s no incentive there.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network BOLT by BOLT</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2018-07-24-la-blockchain-jim-posen-lightning-bolt-by-bolt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2018-07-24-la-blockchain-jim-posen-lightning-bolt-by-bolt/</guid><description>Topic: Lightning Network BOLT by BOLT

I will not be as technical as Olaoluwa was. You have nodes that open up payment channels. This scheme is actually developed at the moment in great detail. So how do you find the channels through which to send payments? So we wanted to propose some initial solution to this.
Routing requirements It should be source routing because we need the privacy. When a user sends a payment, so the decision of what route to choose should be on the sender side, because if he delegates it to an intermediate node then they don&amp;rsquo;t have the necessity to privacy as much.</description></item><item><title>Lightning work group session</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/lightning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/lightning/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/784783992478466049
You have a network. Anyone can join the network. You have two points and you want to do route finding between those two points. To be clear, this is a network of channels. It is similar to the internet, but it is not the internet. How do you find such a route? It&amp;rsquo;s easy when you find all the implements of the network. Some of the information changes frequently. Payments change the balance of the channels so that other payments become impossible.</description></item><item><title>Onion Routing In Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/onion-routing-in-lightning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/onion-routing-in-lightning/</guid><description>http://lightning.network/

Privacy-preserving decentralized micropayments
We&amp;rsquo;re excited about lightning because the second layer could be an important opportunity to improve privacy and fungibility. Also, there might be timing information in the payments themselves.
Distributed set of onion routers (OR, cite OG onionrouting paper). Users create circuits with sub-set of nodes. Difficult for oion routers to gain more info than predecessor+successor in path. Low latency - usable within greater internet. Notable success is tor, notable success of routing nodes.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2016-07-18-laolu-osuntokun-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2016-07-18-laolu-osuntokun-lightning-network/</guid><description>Lightning Network Deep Dive

Fundamentally, the blockchain is shared. You can call it a DLT but it&amp;rsquo;s really a copied ledger.

Okay. Hello everyone. Yes, okay, great. Yes. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m working on Lightning Network. Bitcoin is great and fun to work on.
Basic super quick summary of Lightning I am going to re-cap lightning network real quick. The basic idea is to have channels between two nodes. A channel, from the perspective of the rest of the world, is just a 2-of-2 multisig output. You can&amp;rsquo;t even tell it&amp;rsquo;s multisig, you just see an address with a 3 in front of the address.</description></item><item><title>Network Topologies and their scalability implications on decentralized off-chain networks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/network-topologies-and-their-scalability-implications-on-decentralized-off-chain-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/network-topologies-and-their-scalability-implications-on-decentralized-off-chain-networks/</guid><description>slides: https://scalingbitcoin.org/hongkong2015/presentations/DAY2/1_layer2_3_poon.pdf
LN transactions are real Bitcoin transactions. These are real zero-confirmation transactions. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that the original idea behind Bitcoin was solving the double-spending problem. When you move off-chain and off-block, you sort of have this opposite situation where you use double-spends to your advantage, spending from the same output, except you have this global consensus of block but you have this local ordering that you use through this lightning system of penalties through which you can update the balances between two people.</description></item><item><title>How Lightning.network can offer a solution for Bitcoin's scalability problems</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2015-05-26-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2015-05-26-lightning-network/</guid><description>http://lightning.network/

Joseph Poon joseph@lightning.network Thaddeus Dryja rx@awsomnet.org We&amp;rsquo;re doing a presentation on the lightning network and micropayments. Right now bitcoin faces some interesting problems, like transactions aren&amp;rsquo;t instant, and micropayments don&amp;rsquo;t work. The transaction fees are 1/10th of a cent or higher depending on the exchange rate. And, &amp;ldquo;bitcoin doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale&amp;rdquo; especially if you have a lot of micropayments. One megabyte blocks? Well, let&amp;rsquo;s increase them. What happens? Well, you go from 7 transactons per second with 1 megabyte with about 220 million transactions per year.</description></item><item><title>Amiko Pay</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/amiko-pay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/amiko-pay/</guid><description>Amiko Pay aims to become an implementation of the lightning network. So that previous presentation was a great setup. There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit more to Amiko Pay. If you look through the basic design of the lightning network, there&amp;rsquo;s a network of payment channels. There have been several variations of this idea. Lightning Network happens to be the best so far. What Amiko Pay aims to do is to focus on the nodes, and do the routing between nodes.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Failure Modes And The Role Of The Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/bitcoin-failure-modes-and-the-role-of-the-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/bitcoin-failure-modes-and-the-role-of-the-lightning-network/</guid><description>I am going to be talking about bitcoin failure modes, and Joseph will talk about how the lightning network can help.

We should acknowledge that bitcoin can fail.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Protocol Development Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/bitcoin-protocol-development-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/bitcoin-protocol-development-panel/</guid><description>Bitcoin protocol development panel
KW: We have some wonderful panelists today. Let&amp;rsquo;s kick it off. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Eric. Who are you and what role do you play in bitcoin development?
EL: I got into bitcoin in 2011. I had my own network stack. I almost had a full node implementation but I stopped short because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as well tested or reviewed as Bitcoin Core. So I started to look into the community a little bit.</description></item><item><title>Concurrency And Privacy With Payment Channel Networks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/concurrency-and-privacy-with-payment-channel-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/concurrency-and-privacy-with-payment-channel-networks/</guid><description>paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/820.pdf
Introduction I am going to talk about concurrency and privacy. This was joint work with my collaborators.
Bitcoin has scalability issues. That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason why we are here today. Currently the bitcoin network allows for less than 10 transactions/second. Today we have more than 135 gigabytes of memory requirement. And there are some high fees and micropayments are not really possible. One of the proposals to fix this is payment channels.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 Closing Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/day-1-closing-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/day-1-closing-panel/</guid><description>Closing panel

RS: Thanks guys for joining the panel. We just need to get one more chair. I am going to introduce Alex Petrov here because everyone else was on stage. The closing panel is going to be an overview of what&amp;rsquo;s happening in bitcoin. I want to start with the question I started with last year. What is the current state of bitcoin compared to last year? What has happened?</description></item><item><title>Day 1 Group Summaries</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/day-1-group-summaries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/day-1-group-summaries/</guid><description>We need two to three minute report backs from each session.

Lightning We discussed routing and several aspects of routing algorithms in the lightning network. We talked about the tradeoff between privacy aspects and reliability in routing. We quickly discovered that after some of the things were already resolved by the papers&amp;ndash; the way how we deal with a general separation and channel transaction fees, is actually quite an interesting discussion topic.</description></item><item><title>Designing Lightning Wallets for the Bitcoin Users</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/lightning-wallet-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/lightning-wallet-design/</guid><description>Good morning everyone. Thank you for being here. Thank you to the organizers for this event. My talk is about designing lightning wallets for bitcoin users. I am talking about UX. But really, UX is a lot more than what wallets look like. It&amp;rsquo;s from bip39 and making backups much easier, to anything you cna imagine, to make it easier for bitcoin to use bitcoin.

Fabrice: So I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about fee management in Lightning which has been surprisingly one of the biggest operational issues we had when we launched the Lightning Network. So again the idea of Lightning is you have transactions that are not published but publishable, and in our case the problem is what does exactly publishable mean. So it means the UTXO that you’re spending is still spendable.</description></item><item><title>Htlcs Considered Harmful</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091033955824881664
Introduction I am here to talk about a design pattern that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. You see HTLCs a lot. You see them in a lot of protocols for cross-chain atomic exchanges and payment channel networks such as lightning. But they have some downsides, which people aren&amp;rsquo;t all familiar with. I am not affiliated with Interledger, but they convinced me that HTLCs were a bad idea and they developed an alternative to replace HTLCs.</description></item><item><title>Improvements to Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/maaku-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/maaku-panel/</guid><description>This can be a broad range of topics for improvements.

Introduction Hi. Good morning. I am Zeta. I am going to talk about how to incentivize payment channel watchtowers. This is joint work with my collaborators.
Micropayment channels There are many ways to construct channels such as lightning channels and duplex channels. There&amp;rsquo;s hops, you can route payments, and other proposals more recent ones for doing channels in payment networks like sprites, eltoo, all of them although they are different they all share the fundamental nature of channels.</description></item><item><title>Lightning - The Transfer Layer</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-the-transfer-layer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-the-transfer-layer/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Context Fabrice: Alright so, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the payments model we use in lightning, which is mainly the HTLC, and how it works. So what we&amp;rsquo;ve explained so far is that a channel is basically a funding transaction that&amp;rsquo;s been published. And a commitment transaction that spends from the funding transaction but is not published. So the funding transaction is confirmed and it&amp;rsquo;s on-chain and it sends money to A and B.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-routing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-routing/</guid><description>Introduction Good afternoon everyone. My name is Carla. I am one of the chaincode residents this summer. This talk is going to walk through the protocol layer by layer and look at the different components that make up the network. Lightning is an off-chain scaling solution which consists of a p2p network of payment channels. It allows payments to be forwarded by nodes in exchange for fees.
Scaling with payment channels This involves a payment channel.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Security Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-security-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-security-panel/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137758233865703424
Introduction MF: I will start by thanking Kevin and Lea and the organizers. It&amp;rsquo;s been an awesome event. Thanks also to the sponsors. Without their assistance we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the event. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to make some plugs before we start the conversation. One, I run the London Bitcoin developers group.

I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to introduce the idea of zero-confirmation transactions and lightning. We have given talks about this. There&amp;rsquo;s some documentation available. There&amp;rsquo;s an implementation being worked on. I think it helps a lot with scalability by keeping some transactions off the blockchain. Ideally, many or most transactions. Instead, you would open and close channels. That&amp;rsquo;s all that needs to be on the blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Reproducible Lightning Benchmark</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/reproducible-lightning-benchmark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/reproducible-lightning-benchmark/</guid><description>Reproducible lightning benchmark

Introduction Thanks for the introduction, Jameson. I feel like a rock star now. So yeah, I won&amp;rsquo;t introduce myself. I call myself a code monkey the reason is that a lot of the talks in scaling bitcoin can surprise people but I understood very few of them. The reason is that I am more of an application developer. Basically, I try to understand a lot of the talks but if it&amp;rsquo;s too complex then I just wait until some crypto guy makes a proof-of-concept, then I just make something in C# that other people can use.</description></item><item><title>Security Aspects of Lightning Network Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-routing-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-routing-security/</guid><description>D146 D0F6 8939 4362 68FA 9A13 0E26 BB61 B76C 4D3A

Introduction Together with my colleagues I am building lnd. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the implementations of lightning. In routing, there&amp;rsquo;s the sender of the payment, the intermediate routing nodes that forward payments, and a receiver. I would like to scope this down to looking at security just from the perspective of the sender.
Goals of LN Why are we doing all of this?</description></item><item><title>The Future Of Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-future-of-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-future-of-lightning/</guid><description>The future of lightning

Okay. Hi everyone. Check. Wow. Check one two. Okay it&amp;rsquo;s working. And I have 25 minutes. Great. So I am going to talk about unlinkable outsourced channel modeling. Everyone likes channels. You can update states. You can link them together to make a network. This is really great. There are risks. These are additional risks. The price of scalability is eternal vigilance. You have to keep watching your channels.</description></item></channel></rss>
