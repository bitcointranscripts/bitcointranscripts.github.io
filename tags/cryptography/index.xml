Alright. Strong crowd here, I can see. That&amp;rsquo;s very nice.
Introduction I am Jonas and I will talk about provably bug-free BIPs and implementations. I don&amp;rsquo;t have such a BIP nor such an implementation but if you lower your time-preference enough this could eventually be true at some point. This presentation is only 15 minutes so raise your hand if you have questions.
Just to set the stage. Specifications should be free of bugs, we want them easy to implement and hard to misinterpret.</description></item><item><title>High-assurance cryptography specifications (hac-spec)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2022-10/2022-10-11-hac-spec/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2022-10/2022-10-11-hac-spec/</guid><description>See https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2022/2022-10-14-hac-spec/ instead for a full transcript of a similar talk.
Far far future In the far far future, we could get rid of this weird paper notation scheme and do a security proof directly for the specification. Presumably that is much harder than anything else in my slides. But this would rule out a lot of bugs.
Q: But the security proof itself is written in a paper?
A: The security proof itself would be written in hac-spec.</description></item><item><title>Checking Bitcoin balances privately</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/checking-bitcoin-balances-privately/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/checking-bitcoin-balances-privately/</guid><description>In this video, the Wasabi Research Club delves into the topic of checking Bitcoin balances privately. They discuss the use of homomorphic encryption and private information retrieval to protect users&amp;rsquo; privacy when querying data from a server. They explore different solutions and strategies to address challenges such as address linkability, block retrieval, and the scalability and cost of checking balances. The team also emphasizes the need for an open standard for private information retrieval to ensure decentralization. They discuss the use of Tor and homomorphic encryption together, as well as the possibility of batching requests to improve efficiency. The video concludes by highlighting the ongoing research and exploration of potential solutions to ensure private querying of Bitcoin balances and more&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Anonymous Credentials</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/anonymous-credentials/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/anonymous-credentials/</guid><description>Jonas Nick discusses anonymous credentials and their applications in this section. Anonymous credentials involve getting a blinded token signed by a server, where the server does not see the message being signed. These tokens contain attributes that can be selectively revealed, and range proofs can be used to verify attributes without revealing additional information. The speaker highlights the flexibility and security of anonymous credentials and how they improve on traditional signatures. They also discuss advancements in these credentials, such as mercurial signatures and delegateable anonymous credentials. The speaker mentions the work of Del Tauri and their solution for creating a divisible e-cash system using homomorphic cryptographic commitments, range proofs, and blind signature schemes. They also discuss the merging and breaking of anonymous credentials, as well as reissuing tokens without exposing the individual values. The implementation and linkability of credentials are also explored in the conversation. Overall, the participants express the need for further study and propose focusing on the cryptography part of the scheme in the next session.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Protocol Risks And Vulnerabilities</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coordination-of-decentralized-finance-workshop/2020-stanford/consensus-protocol-risks-and-vulnerabilities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coordination-of-decentralized-finance-workshop/2020-stanford/consensus-protocol-risks-and-vulnerabilities/</guid><description>Consensus protocol risks and vulnerabilities

Introduction I am going to talk about why cryptocurrencies matter. I am going to take the skeptics side. I am going to start from a banker&amp;rsquo;s standpoint why a lot of the things that cryptocurrency people land say don&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
Where are the engineers coming from? An engineer will look at something like Visa and say this is horrible. These are systems from 50-100 years ago.</description></item><item><title>Coinshuffle++ (Part 2)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/coinshuffle-plusplus-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/coinshuffle-plusplus-part-2/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s episode Tim Ruffing explores the concept of disruption in the Coinshuffle++ protocol and how it can be detected. He explains that the protocol passively observes messages and their outcomes, without knowing which message belongs to each participant. The speaker also discusses the practicality of blocking someone from the protocol, mentioning the role of network setting and the potential power of an attacker. Additionally, Ruffing highlights the importance of multiple communication rounds, protocols for key exchange, and the need for peers to verify if the protocol has been disrupted. Further Tim explains the concept of introducing another broadcast round in Coinshuffle++ to avoid disruption. By replacing one broadcast with another, the protocol ensures that if one message is disrupted, all messages are disrupted. This eliminates the need for a broadcast round to check for disruption, as participants can simply look at the list of messages and determine if their own message is there or not. This approach provides a guarantee of message integrity without additional broadcasts. Ruffing also addresses the limitations of Coinshuffle++, such as the lack of privacy in transactions with unequal inputs and the inability to pay while mixing. He discusses potential solutions for the anonymity of payments and emphasizes the benefits of Coinshuffle++ for coin shuffling. The timing and trust aspects of the protocol are also discussed, with a mention of potential delays and the need to trust other peers. Overall, Coinshuffle++ offers improvements in message integrity and coin mixing, but there is room for further development in addressing certain limitations and ensuring robust anonymity.</description></item><item><title>CoinShuffle++ (Part 1)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/coinshuffle-plusplus-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/coinshuffle-plusplus-part-1/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s episode Tim Ruffing introduces the CoinShuffle++ protocol and explains its key components. He describes how the protocol uses power sums and polynomial roots to ensure secure messaging between participants. The protocol consists of four stages: Dimi Hellman key exchange, commitment, DC net, and confirmation. The protocol handles malicious peers by revealing secret keys and excluding them in the next round. Ruffing also highlights the scalability of the CoinShuffle++ protocol, as it can accommodate a large number of participants and complete the process in a relatively short time. The use of dice mix enhances the efficiency of the protocol compared to its predecessor, CoinShuffle. Futher Tim dives into the challenges of implementing CoinShuffle++, a decentralized protocol for coinjoining cryptocurrencies. He highlights the issues caused by varying internet connection speeds and round communication, leading to slower performance. Ruffing also discusses concerns about the negotiation process and cryptography affecting communication speed. Additionally, he acknowledges the complexity of the topic and expresses a desire to simplify it for wider understanding and implementation. Overall, Ruffing emphasizes the importance of maintaining privacy in peer-to-peer transactions and the potential of cryptography in various applications.</description></item><item><title>The 'Crypto' In Cryptocurrency: Why Everything is Weird and Hard</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/crypto-in-cryptocurrency/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/crypto-in-cryptocurrency/</guid><description>I do not have any slides for you.

Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of VDFs and make sure that we&amp;rsquo;re on the same page. I want to make sure everyone knows what it is that we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.
The goal of a VDF is to slow things down. The question is, how do we slow things down in a verifiable way?
What is a VDF? I won&amp;rsquo;t give a precise definition, look at the manuscripts. A VDF is basically a function that is supposed to take T steps to evaluate, even if the honest party has polynomial parallelism.</description></item><item><title>Handel: Practical Multi-Signature Aggregation for Large Byzantine Committees</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/handel-practical-multisig-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/handel-practical-multisig-aggregation/</guid><description>Introduction Handle is a aggregation protocol for large scale byzantine committees. This is work with my colleagues in addition to myself.
Why aggregate? Distributed systems often require gathering statements about large subsets of nodes. However, processing (filtering, aggregating&amp;hellip;) measurements can be a bottleneck. We want to apply some processing while collecting the measurements.
Why byzantine? A byzantine node is a node that can be arbitrary. It can be offline and it can be anything it wants and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to respect the protocol specification.</description></item><item><title>Fireside chat with Dan Boneh</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/grincon/2019/dan-boneh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/grincon/2019/dan-boneh/</guid><description>TL: I was one of the founders of SF Bitcoin Devs with aantonop.

Introduction One of the most powerful things that you can do with SNARKs is something called recursive proofs where you actually prove that another SNARK was correct. I can give you a proof of a proof of a proof and this is amazing because you can prove an ever-expanding computation like a blockchain is always correct. I can always give you a proof that you have the latest block and you know the entire blockchain and all the transactions in it are correct.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Accelerated RSA - VDFs, SNARKs, and Accumulators</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/hardware-accelerated-rsa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/hardware-accelerated-rsa/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230551345700069377

Video intro text There are several different standards covering selection of curves for use in elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). Each of these standards tries to ensure that the elliptic-curve discrete-logarithm problem (ECDLP) is difficult. ECDLP is the problem of finding an ECC user&amp;rsquo;s secret key, given the user&amp;rsquo;s public key.
Unfortunately, there is a gap between ECDLP difficulty and ECC security.</description></item><item><title>Scriptless Lotteries</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/scriptless-lotteries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/scriptless-lotteries/</guid><description>Scriptless lotteries on bitcoin from oblivious transfer

Lotteries Imagine a trusted party who conducts lotteries between Alice and Bob. The goal of the lottery protocol is to use a cryptographic protocol without having a lottery trusted party.</description></item><item><title>Security Assumptions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/security-assumptions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/security-assumptions/</guid><description>Hi, welcome back.
I am a developer for libsecp256k1. It&amp;rsquo;s a library that does the underlying traditional cryptography used in Bitcoin. I am going to talk about security assumptions, security models and trust models. I am going to give a high-level overview of how we should be thinking about these issues for scaling and efficiency and decentralization. Bitcoin is a crypto system. Everything about it is a crypto system. It needs to be designed with an adversarial mindset, even in an adversarial setting.</description></item><item><title>Siacoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/siacoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/siacoin/</guid><description>I have been working on a decentralized cloud storage platform. Before I go into that, I wanted to mention that I have been working on Bitcoin since 2011. Since 2013 I have been in the wizards channel. In 2014 a friend and myself founded a company to build Siacoin. The team has grown to 3 people. Sia is the name of our decentralized storage protocol. We are trying to emulate Amazon S3.</description></item><item><title>Todo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/todo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/todo/</guid><description> cryptography bootcamp https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre139cwM0pjuxMa_YVzMeCiTf mathematics of modern cryptography https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre10kb0so1PQ3eNz4Q6EBfecT historical papers in cryptography https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre13lX4C_5ZCQKMDOniAn24NP securing computation https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKuh-lKre12ddBkIB8wNC8D1kag5dEr-</description></item></channel></rss>
