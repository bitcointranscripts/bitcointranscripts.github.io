Introduction Okay, so, first question- who put my name on that list and what do they want? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t me. I&amp;rsquo;ll ask questions. I can give a summary, but there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk already and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to focus on. What would sipa like us to review in particular about it? What design decisions do you feel least confident about? Is there anything where you would like other people to investigate design decisions before charging ahead?</description></item><item><title>Taproot and Graftroot</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/taproot-and-graftroot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/taproot-and-graftroot/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1047764770265284608
Introduction Taproot and graftroot are recent proposals in the bitcoin world. Every script type looks different and they are distinct. From a privacy perspective, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty bad. You watermark or fingerprint yourself all the time by showing unique scripts on the blockchain or in your transactions. This causes censorship risks and other problems for fungibility. Often you are paying for contigencies that are never used, like the whoopsies branches in your scripts.</description></item></channel></rss>
