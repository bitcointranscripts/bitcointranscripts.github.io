But what it consists of? They&amp;rsquo;re using several things like identities and people hosting their own data.
AOPP For identity, the first thing I want to mention is Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP). This is the field that we added in BlueWallet some months ago. I think it was a Switzerland exchange that wanted this, so they sent us a pull request and we merged it (PR#2915, PR#4431).</description></item><item><title>Explaining RGB Tokens</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-explained/explaining-rgb-tokens/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-explained/explaining-rgb-tokens/</guid><description>Intro Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:45

Welcome back Ruben. Ruben, did you start selling your tweets yet?

I tried to sell one of my tweets to my sister but she said, &amp;ldquo;What the hell are you doing?</description></item><item><title>Progress on Scaling via Client-Side Validation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/client-side-validation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/client-side-validation/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/785121442602029056

Let&amp;rsquo;s start with what isn&amp;rsquo;t client-side validation. I am going to call this the miner-side approach. Here&amp;rsquo;s some smart contract code. In this example, it&amp;rsquo;s Chronos which is a timestamping contract. What you have here is a contract that stores in ethereum state consensus some hashes as they are received, they are timestamped. And ultimately at some point in the future you could go and ask the ethereum state machine, you know, did you go and get this hash?</description></item></channel></rss>
