(00:00)
So, let&amp;rsquo;s go start off. What is transaction replacement? And maybe not the best screen, but this is a screenshot of the Bitcoin wallet, Blue Wallet, and it shows off transaction replacement very nicely. I have a transaction, I got rid of $25 worth of Bitcoin, and I can do two things, I can go bump the fee or cancel the transaction, and if any of you guys played around with it, it does what it expects, it increases the fee or it cancels it.</description></item><item><title>SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, ephemeral anchors and LN symmetry (ELTOO)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/sighash-anyprevout-ephemeral-anchors-and-ln-symmetry-eltoo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/sighash-anyprevout-ephemeral-anchors-and-ln-symmetry-eltoo/</guid><description>Greg Sanders joins us to discuss ANYPREVOUT, ephemeral anchors and LN symmetry (a.k.a.

Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:29
It was too hot all summer and then it was nice for about a week and now we&amp;rsquo;re back to too cold.

Hello, welcome, and listeners, sorry for the maybe not perfect sound quality, because we have to make do with the remote recording.

Yeah, for the second time since we&amp;rsquo;re making our show my laptop broke, so here I am on my phone.

Aaron and Sjors explain three advantages of RBF: the option the “speed up” a transaction (1), which can in turn result in a more effective fee market for block space (2), as well as the potential to make more efficient use of block space by updating transactions to include more recipients (3). The main disadvantage of RBF is that it makes it slightly easier to double spend unconfirmed transactions, which was also at the root of last week’s “double spend” controversy that dominated headlines. Aaron and Sjors discuss some solutions to diminish this risk, including “opt-in RBF” which is currently implemented in Bitcoin Core. Finally, Sjors explains in detail how opt-in RBF works in Bitcoin Core, and which conditions must be met before a transaction is considered replaceable. He also notes some complications with this version of RBF, for example in the context of the Lightning Network.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Wallets/UTXO Management</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-09-enterprise-walletsutxo-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-09-enterprise-walletsutxo-management/</guid><description>Mark Erhardt: 00:00:00
Just to throw out a few numbers there, non-SegWit inputs cost almost 300 bytes, and native SegWit inputs cost slightly more than 100 bytes. There&amp;rsquo;s almost a reduction by two-thirds in fees if you switch from non-SegWit to native SegWit.
