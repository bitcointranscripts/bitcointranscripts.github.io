Intro Today I’m going to talk about building on lnd from the perspective of we want to have developers building on lnd. Developers, developers, developers. I just have so many slides today that let’s leave questions to the end if I have any time because I over made slides.
Design Philosophy So what is the big idea behind lnd? What are we thinking about when we’re developing lnd and what do we want lnd to be?</description></item><item><title>Alex Bosworth - Incentive Problems in the Lightning Network (2018-09-18)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-09-18-alex-bosworth-incentive-problems-in-the-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-09-18-alex-bosworth-incentive-problems-in-the-lightning-network/</guid><description>Alex Bosworth

Incentive Problems in the Lightning Network I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about high-level incentive problems in the Lighting Network.
Mechanisms The first thing to think about is that we have two different mechanisms for making Bitcoin and lightning work. One mechanism is math — If you do a SHA 256 of something you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about incentives, whether that&amp;rsquo;s going to match to the expected result.</description></item><item><title>Christian Decker - C-Lightning Questions (2019-09-04)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-09-04-christian-decker-c-lightning-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-09-04-christian-decker-c-lightning-questions/</guid><description>Christian Decker

Introduction Hello everyone. I’m Christian. I’m a software developer at Blockstream and I work on Lightning, both the specification and the implementation. Today we are going to have a shortish webinar on how to get started with Lightning.
Q and A Q - Is it possible to run c-lightning and lnd on the same host in parallel?
A - It absolutely is.</description></item><item><title>Conner Fromknecht - Lnd 0.6 Beta (2019-05-02)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-05-02-conner-fromknecht-lnd-0.6-beta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-05-02-conner-fromknecht-lnd-0.6-beta/</guid><description>Conner Fromknecht

LND 0.6 Beta Deep Dive
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkyPw2_l6YE
Intro lnd 0.6 was about seven months in the making. There’s more things that we could fit into this talk alone but I cherrypicked some of the highlights and things that will have some real world impact on users of the network or people who are using the API or just generally users of lnd. The high level impact on the network going forward and how we plan to scale up for the next 100K channels that come onto the network.</description></item><item><title>Conner Fromknecht - Watchtowers (2019-04-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-conner-fromknecht-watchtowers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-conner-fromknecht-watchtowers/</guid><description>Conner Fromknecht

Intro Pretty excited today to speak on the topic of watchtowers. It is something that we at Lightning Labs have been working on for almost a year now. Conceptual proof of concept code to really flushing it out into what would be today more of a full on protocol. Hopefully today we’re going to summarize a year of research into this presentation.</description></item><item><title>Joost Jager - HODL Invoices (2019-06-13)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-09-joost-jager-hodl-invoices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-09-joost-jager-hodl-invoices/</guid><description>Joost Jager

Intro My name is Joost, Michael introduced me already. I’ve been working with Lightning Labs since the middle of last year and during that time I’ve worked on several subprojects within lnd. lnd is the Lightning implementation developed by Lightning Labs. I’m not sure really what the background knowledge is at this point in this three day course. One of those subprojects within lnd is called hodl invoices and this is the topic that I would like to talk about today.</description></item><item><title>Laolu Osuntokun - Exploring Lnd0.4 (2018-04-20)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2018-04-20-laolu-osuntokun-exploring-lnd0.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2018-04-20-laolu-osuntokun-exploring-lnd0.4/</guid><description>Laolu Osuntokun and Conner Fromknecht

The Genesis of lnd First, the genesis of lnd. Here is the first commit of lnd. It was October 27 2015. This is when I was in school still. This was done when I went on break and it was the first major…. we had in terms of code. We talked about the language we’re using, the licensing, the architecture of the daemon.</description></item><item><title>Laolu, Joost, Oliver - Lnd0.10 (2020-04-18)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/vr-bitcoin/2020-04-18-laolu-joost-oliver-lnd0.10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/vr-bitcoin/2020-04-18-laolu-joost-oliver-lnd0.10/</guid><description>Name: Laolu Osuntokun, Joost Jager and Oliver Gugger

Introduction Together with my colleagues I am building lnd. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the implementations of lightning. In routing, there&amp;rsquo;s the sender of the payment, the intermediate routing nodes that forward payments, and a receiver. I would like to scope this down to looking at security just from the perspective of the sender.</description></item><item><title>Ln Present And Future Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</guid><description>Lightning network present &amp;amp; future panel

LC: Can everyone hear me now? Alright, alright.
WO: It&amp;rsquo;s getting some good usage. A lot of those are businesses. Definitely it&amp;rsquo;s in the early stage. Elizabeth talked about this. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things that are mostly for fun, it&amp;rsquo;s not really at ecommerce yet.
LC: That&amp;rsquo;s for lnd?
WO: Sure, and I think Lisa can talk about c-lightning.</description></item><item><title>Pierre Rochard - Excel In Lightning (2018-10-27)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-hack-day/2018-10-27-pierre-rochard-excel-in-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-hack-day/2018-10-27-pierre-rochard-excel-in-lightning/</guid><description>Pierre Rochard

Demo I want to present a project I’ve been hacking on for the past month which is getting lnd inside of Excel. I’ll explain why someone would ever do that. I want to bring Lightning to the most popular business platform in existence today which is Microsoft Office Excel. It’s installed on hundreds of millions of computers around the world.</description></item><item><title>Pierre Rochard - Lightning Excel Plugin (2018-10-26)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-26-pierre-rochard-lightning-excel-plugin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-26-pierre-rochard-lightning-excel-plugin/</guid><description>Pierre Rochard
Lightning Excel Plugin

Demo My project is to create a user interface for lightning that might appeal to a different crowd than ours. We’re kind of used to Linux, open source, free software so being in a proprietary environment like Excel is unfamiliar territory for us. And yet I think that there is a large demographic of people who are interested in Bitcoin who work in the business world where they use Excel day to day.</description></item></channel></rss>
