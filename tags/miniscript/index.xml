Hello and welcome back to the Bitcoin.review. Today we have a very interesting show. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a knife fight. Two men go into a room with one knife. One comes out. On my left side, Rindell for team MPC, weighing 64 kilobytes. On my right side, Rob for team script with variable sizing, so we don&amp;rsquo;t know. Is this already a loss? We don&amp;rsquo;t know, let&amp;rsquo;s find out.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core 25.0</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v25/</guid><description>Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:21

Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:24
Hey, Sjors, we&amp;rsquo;re back. We&amp;rsquo;re back in beautiful, sunny Utrecht after I spent some time in Miami and Prague. You spent some time in Prague, and more Prague, is that right?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:38
Mostly Prague.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:38
You were in Prague for a while. That&amp;rsquo;s where we recorded the previous episode about Stratum V2.</description></item><item><title>Timelock-enabled safety and recovery use cases for Bitcoin users</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2023/timelock-enabled-safety-and-recovery-use-cases-for-bitcoin-users/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2023/timelock-enabled-safety-and-recovery-use-cases-for-bitcoin-users/</guid><description>Introduction Can we give a round of applause for Kevin, and welcome him to the stage. Thank you. Alright, yeah, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a talk around Timelocks in Bitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a pretty quick introduction on the different types of Timelocks over time in Bitcoin, and where we&amp;rsquo;re at today. Also, a little bit, very, very quickly talking about what we&amp;rsquo;re using Timelocks for in Bitcoin today.</description></item><item><title>Miniscript: Composable, Analyzable and Smarter Bitcoin Script</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-sanket-kanjalkar-miniscript/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-sanket-kanjalkar-miniscript/</guid><description>Andrew Poelstra on Miniscript: https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-04-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/
Intro (Jeff Gallas) The next speaker is Sanket. He is working at Blockstream and is mostly working on Simplicity and Miniscript and that is also what he is going to talk about, Miniscript. Please welcome Sanket.
Intro (Sanket Kanjalkar) Good morning everyone. Today I will be discussing Miniscript which is a work of Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra and me with input from many Bitcoiners. It has been changing constantly since summer of 2019 but now it is in a fairly stable state to share and get more deployment.</description></item><item><title>Miniscript - Custody, Computable, Composable</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-06-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-06-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/</guid><description>Slides: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/2021-11-tabconf/slides.pdf
Intro I am here to talk about Miniscript. This is something that I have talked about a few times before but usually in a much more technical way where we get into the weeds of Bitcoin Script and what Miniscript is and how to use it and stuff. I want to talk today about Miniscript from the perspective of someone actually trying to use Bitcoin and how this solves problems that I think are very important in the space regarding how to custody your coins, how to keep track of your keys, stuff like that.</description></item><item><title>Magical Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/la-bitdevs/2020-05-21-alekos-filini-magical-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/la-bitdevs/2020-05-21-alekos-filini-magical-bitcoin/</guid><description>Magical Bitcoin site: https://magicalbitcoin.org/

Transcript of London Bitcoin Devs Miniscript presentation: https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-04-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/
Part 1 So what we’re going to do, there is a couple of things. We are going to go through the Miniscript website and learn about how Miniscript is constructed, how the type system works, some of the anti-malleability rules. Then we’re going to go to a repo that I created last night, a Git repo with some example programs.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Miniscript</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-andrew-poelstra-miniscript-intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-andrew-poelstra-miniscript-intro/</guid><description>Slides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vgh5vaooqqbgg1v/andrew-poelstra.pdf
Intro Hi everyone. Some of you were at my Bitcoin dev presentation about Miniscript a couple of days where I managed to spend over 2 hours giving a presentation about this. I think I got this one down to 20 minutes but no promises. I will keep an eye on the clock.
Descriptors It is very nice having this scheduled immediately after Andrew Chow’s talk about output descriptors because there is a good transition here.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar 3</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-10-14-socratic-seminar-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-10-14-socratic-seminar-3/</guid><description>https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Bitcoin-Developers/events/265295570/
https://bitdevs.org/2019-09-16-socratic-seminar-96
We have sort of done two meetups in this format. The idea here is that in NY there&amp;rsquo;s BitDevs which is one of the oldest meetups. This has been going on for five years. They have a format called socratic where they have a talented guy named J who leads them through some topics and they try to get some discussion going on and pull from expertise in the audience.</description></item><item><title>Tales from the Crypt with Andrew Poelstra</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tftc-podcast/2019-06-18-andrew-poelstra-tftc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tftc-podcast/2019-06-18-andrew-poelstra-tftc/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1160178010986876928

How the idea of Taproot was formed Andrew: There are some small off suit IRC channels of bitcoin-wizards where people discuss some specific topics such as Minisketch which is a set reconciliation protocol that was developed by Greg Maxwell, Pieter Wuille and Gleb Naumenko among a couple of others. It was mostly those three. They have a channel where they talk about things. There is one where there was a whole bunch of discussion leading up to the Taproot BIP proposal.</description></item><item><title>Miniscript</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/noded-podcast/2019-05-11-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/noded-podcast/2019-05-11-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/</guid><description>Noded podcast May 10th 2019

Jeremy: Our next speaker really needs no introduction. However, I am obligated to deliver an introduction anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m not just trying to avoid pronouncing his name which is known to be unpronounceable. I am pleased to welcome Pieter Wuille to stage to present on miniscript.
Introduction Thanks, Jeremy. I am Pieter Wuille. I work at Blockstream. I do various things. Today I will be talking about miniscript, which is a joint effort between myself and some colleagues at Blockstream particularly Andrew Poelstra.</description></item></channel></rss>
