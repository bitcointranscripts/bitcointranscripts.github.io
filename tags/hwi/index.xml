Welcome to Bitcoin Explained, the podcast with the most boring name in Bitcoin. Hey Sjors.
Sjors: 00:00:27
What&amp;rsquo;s up? What&amp;rsquo;s with the new name?
Aaron: 00:00:29
So We&amp;rsquo;ve rebranded our podcast. What do you think?
Sjors: 00:00:33
Well, I think, you know, especially if you read it correctly, Bitcoin, explained. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing name. I think the problem was that a lot of people have no idea what the hell a Van Weerdam Shores Nado is.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallet Integration in Bitcoin Core and HWI</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/hardware-wallet-integration-in-bitcoin-core-and-hwi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/hardware-wallet-integration-in-bitcoin-core-and-hwi/</guid><description>Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:46
Live from Utrecht this is The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. Hello! Are you running the BIP8 True independent client yet?
Sjors Provoost: 00:01:56
Negative. I did not even know there was one.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:59
One has been launched, started. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s actually a client yet, a project has started.
Sjors Provoost: 00:02:05
Okay, a project has started, it&amp;rsquo;s not a binary or a code that you can compile.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets in Bitcoin Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>Slides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k02o32d0pagac4r/Andrew%20Chow%20slides.pdf

Introduction Hey everyone. As you may have guessed I’m Andrew Chow. I’m Engineer at Blockstream and I also work on Bitcoin Core a lot, mostly in the wallet. I am going to be talking about hardware wallets and a bit history with them in Core and also how to integrate them in Core and how we are integrating them into Core.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136924010955104257
How much should Bitcoin Core do, and how much should other libraries do? Andrew Chow wrote the wonderful HWI tool. Right now we have a pull request to support external signers. The HWI script can talk to most major hardware wallets because it has all the drivers built in now, and it can get keys from it, and sign arbitrary transactions. That&amp;rsquo;s roughly what it does. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of manual, though.</description></item></channel></rss>
