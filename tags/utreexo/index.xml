Intros Michael Folkson (MF): This is a discussion on AssumeUTXO. We are lucky to have James O’Beirne on the call. There is a reading list that I will share in a second with a bunch of links going right from concept, some of the podcasts James has done, a couple of presentations James has done. And then towards the end hopefully we will get pretty technical and in the weeds of some of the current, past and future PRs.</description></item><item><title>How much Security is too much Security?

It&amp;rsquo;s been a long year without conferences. And I guess for maybe many people watching the MIT Bitcoin Expo last March, was the last time I saw a bunch of people in person before this whole thing. Thanks to Neha, that was a really good start off for the day.</description></item><item><title>What Is Utreexo?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/what-is-utreexo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/what-is-utreexo/</guid><description>The discussion revolves around Utreexo, a novel proposal aimed at enhancing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s scalability by optimizing the UTXO set storage through a compact, Merkle tree-based structure. Utreexo seeks to address the challenges of node synchronization speeds and RAM usage by allowing nodes to store a much smaller representation of the UTXO set, thus potentially accelerating the syncing process and making the network more efficient. The conversation delves into the technical mechanisms of Utreexo, its implementation challenges, and the practical benefits it offers, including reduced memory requirements and the facilitation of faster node operations. While acknowledging Utreexo&amp;rsquo;s promising advantages for Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s scalability, the participants also weigh its potential downsides, such as increased bandwidth for block transmission and the necessity for significant network adoption to realize its full benefits.</description></item><item><title>ZkVM: zero-knowledge virtual machine for fast confidential smart contracts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/zkvm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/zkvm/</guid><description>https://medium.com/stellar-developers-blog/zkvm-a-new-design-for-fast-confidential-smart-contracts-d1122890d9ae and https://twitter.com/oleganza/status/1126612382728372224

Introduction Okay, welcome. What is zkvm? It&amp;rsquo;s a multi-asset blockchain architecture that combines smart contracts and confidentiality features. It&amp;rsquo;s written in pure rust from top to bottom.

Agenda I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the good parts, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll explain away the bad parts. Sounds like a good time.
What does this have to do with bitcoin? zkvm is a unique combination of the best ideas in the blockchain space.</description></item><item><title>Acumulator Based Cryptography &amp; UTreexo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/accumulators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/accumulators/</guid><description>https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10-08-utxo-accumulators-and-utreexo/

Introduction You still download everything; instead of writing to your UTXO database, you modify your accumulator. You accept a proof that it&amp;rsquo;s in the UTXO accumulator, you put it in there yourself, you just don&amp;rsquo;t remember it anymore. The end result is that you store less than a kilobyte instead of 4 GB or so. But the downside is that you need all these proofs.</description></item><item><title>UTXO accumulators, UTXO commitments, and Utreexo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10/2018-10-08-utxo-accumulators-and-utreexo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10/2018-10-08-utxo-accumulators-and-utreexo/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1049112390413897728
If people saw Benedikt&amp;rsquo;s talk, two days ago, it&amp;rsquo;s related. It&amp;rsquo;s a different construction but same goal. The basic idea is, and I think Cory kind of started to talk about this a few months ago on the mailing list&amp;hellip; instead of storing all UTXOs in leveldb, store the hash of each UTXO, and then it&amp;rsquo;s half the size, and then you could almost create it from the hash of the input, it&amp;rsquo;s like 10 bytes more.</description></item><item><title>Utreexo: Reducing bitcoin nodes to 1 kilobyte</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2019/utreexo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2019/utreexo/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1104410958716387328

Introduction I am going to talk about another scaling solution and another strategy I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for about 6-9 months, called Utreexo.
Bitcoin scalability Scalability has been a concern in bitcoin for the whole time. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the first thing that anyone said about bitcoin. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto said hey I made this thing called bitcoin. Some guy on the mailing list, James A.</description></item></channel></rss>
