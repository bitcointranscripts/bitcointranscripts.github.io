Who are we recording today?
Jonas: 00:00:05
We have Steve Lee in the office this week.
Murch: 00:00:04
He is the head at Spiral. He&amp;rsquo;s done a lot of open source development. He talks to a bunch of people. He&amp;rsquo;s also the PM for the LDK team. So we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk Lightning, the challenges that are open with Lightning, and maybe a little bit about other projects in the space.</description></item></channel></rss>
