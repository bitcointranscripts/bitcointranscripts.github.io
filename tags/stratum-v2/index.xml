Described the three layers of my main PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432
Noise protocol Transport based on the TransportV1 / TransportV2 class Application layer (listens on new port, sv2 apps connect to it) Discussion point: the Job Declarator client role typically runs on the same machine as the template provider, so technically we don’t need noise encryption. However, we may in the future want to “take over” some of the Job Declarator client work, at which point we would need it.</description></item><item><title>Lightning updates / Stratum V2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-updates-stratum-v2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-updates-stratum-v2/</guid><description>Speaker 0: 00:00:00

Who are we recording today? We have Steve Lee in the office this week. He is the head at Spiral. Yeah. He&amp;rsquo;s done a lot of open source development. He talks to a bunch of people. He&amp;rsquo;s also the PM for the LDK team. So we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk Lightning, the challenges that are open with Lightning, and maybe a little bit about other projects in the space.</description></item></channel></rss>
