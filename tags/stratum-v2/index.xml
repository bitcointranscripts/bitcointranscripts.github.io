Spiral has been contributing to this project for a few years. There&amp;rsquo;s a few other companies funding it as well. It&amp;rsquo;s finally ready for testing.
History About 4 years ago or so, Matt proposed BetterHash which focused on enabling miners to be able to do their own transaction selection. There was an independent effort from Braaains that they called stratum v2 which added encryption and authentication between miners and pools and other improvements over stratum v1 like switching from JSON to binary and some other optimizations that were needed over the past 10 years.</description></item></channel></rss>
