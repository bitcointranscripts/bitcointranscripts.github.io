I think I don&amp;rsquo;t have any computer yet. Oh.. It&amp;rsquo;s just okay. All right, I just, I just just read. There&amp;rsquo;s a pointer, okay, great great. I was a bit confused for a second. Can I start? great, so welcome, I&amp;rsquo;m Christian Lewe. I work for Blockstream to research where I mainly work on Simplicity and Miniscript and it&amp;rsquo;s great that we just had a talk on Miniscript so you all know why Miniscript is great, why you should use Miniscript, and in my talk I want to go beyond that.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar - BIP Taproot (BIP 341)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-07-21-socratic-seminar-bip-taproot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-07-21-socratic-seminar-bip-taproot/</guid><description>Pastebin of the resources discussed: https://pastebin.com/vsT3DNqW

Intro So Simplicity is a programming language that I have been working on at Blockstream. I call it an alternative or reimagination of Bitcoin Script as it would have been if I had invented Bitcoin. An alternative or new instruction set that is compatible with Bitcoin. It could be soft forked in. We’ve experimented with it on sidechains such as Elements or Liquid.</description></item><item><title>Simplicity: A New Language for Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-25-russell-oconnor-simplicity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-25-russell-oconnor-simplicity/</guid><description>Slides: https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/slides-bpase-2018.pdf

Intro Good morning everyone. I have been working on a new language for the consensus layer of blockchains and I am here to present that to you today.
Blockchains and Smart Contracts I know everyone is familiar with this in the audience but I want to make sure that I’m on the same page with you guys. How do blockchains and smart contracts and programming languages work together?</description></item><item><title>Smart Signatures: Experiments in Authorization</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-24-christopher-allen-smart-signatures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-24-christopher-allen-smart-signatures/</guid><description>Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherA/smart-signaturesexperiments-in-authentication-stanford-bpase-2018-final
Intro Good afternoon. My name is Christopher Allen, I am with Blockstream and today I wanted to give you an introduction to something that isn’t about consensus, isn’t about proof of stake and other things. I want to pop up a level. I want to talk about smart signatures. These are a number of experiments in authorization.
Digital Signatures First we need to recap, what is a digital signature?</description></item></channel></rss>
