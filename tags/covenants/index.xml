As usual, nothing is happening in Bitcoin and we figured, what a great day to put people to sleep in a one to three hour podcast. We don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. We actually don&amp;rsquo;t know how this is going to play out at all. I have here with me Mr. Rijndael. Hello, sir. Welcome back.
Rijndael: 00:01:30
Hello. Good morning.
NVK: 00:01:32
Good morning.</description></item><item><title>OP_Vault - A New Way to HODL?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</guid><description>Stephan:

Damn. Yeah, well, in terms of on the show, yeah, actually in person, you know, a couple of times, some of the conferences and things. But I know you&amp;rsquo;ve got this awesome proposal out, and it looks pretty interesting to me, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure SLP listeners will be very interested to hear more about it.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin R&amp;D Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/bitcoin-randd-panel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/bitcoin-randd-panel/</guid><description>Ayush: 00:00:07

Covenants and BIP119 I was asked by an old colleague to respond to your post because I came up with the term covenant as applied Bitcoin many years ago back when I was still a Bitcoin developer.
does bip 119 completely mess the fungibility of bitcoin. If the idea of covenants is that you can create bitcoin that can only be sent to certain addresses, doesnt that make two classes of bitcoin?</description></item><item><title>Covenants</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/</guid><description>Topic: Covenants

As per Socratic village rules names of all attendees (other than the advertised speakers) have been anonymized and audio will not be published to preserve anonymity of the question askers.
The covenant concept Shaun Apps (SA): I’ll kick things off with a bit of an introduction. Both Andrew and Jeremy will present. And then we will go through some questions and we&amp;rsquo;ll go to questions from the audience after that.</description></item><item><title>Sydney Socratic Seminar</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2021-06-01-socratic-seminar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2021-06-01-socratic-seminar/</guid><description>Topic: Agenda in Google Doc below

Intro (Michael Folkson) This is London Bitcoin Devs. This is on Zoom and live-streaming on YouTube. Last week we had a Socratic Seminar on vaults, covenants and CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. There is a video up for that. There is also a transcript, @btctranscripts on Twitter. Regarding questions Kevin and Antoine are going to pause during the presentation for questions and comments. We are not going to have interruptions so we will let them speak until they pass.</description></item><item><title>Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees - MAST</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-06-merkleized-abstract-syntax-trees-mast/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-06-merkleized-abstract-syntax-trees-mast/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/972120890279432192

MAST stuff You could directly merkleize scripts if you switch from IF, IFNOT, ELSE with IFJUMP that has the number of bytes.
With graftroot and taproot, you never to do any scripts (which were a hack to get things started). But we&amp;rsquo;re doing validation and computation.
You take every single path it has; so instead, it becomes &amp;hellip; certain condition, or certain not conditions&amp;hellip; You take every possible ifs, you use this, you say it&amp;rsquo;s one of these, then you specify which one, and you show it and everyone else can validate this.</description></item><item><title>Covenants - Structuring Multi Transaction Contracts in Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/2017-01-26-jeremy-rubin-covenants/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/2017-01-26-jeremy-rubin-covenants/</guid><description>Structuring Multi Transaction Contracts in Bitcoin
Location: BPASE 2017, Stanford University
Slides: https://rubin.io/public/pdfs/multi-txn-contracts.pdf
Intro Hey everyone. How is it going? Happy to be going last right now given that I had all these wonderful speakers before me to explain so much of what I am about to tell you. I’m going to talk to you today about structuring multi-transaction contracts in Bitcoin. I think there is a lot of great work that happens in Bitcoin at the script level, at the individual input and output.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Covenants: Opportunities and Challenges</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/covenants/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/covenants/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/785071789705728000
We published this last February at an academic workshop. The work itself has interesting ramifications. My real goal here is to start a conversation and then do a follow-up blog post where we collate feedback from the community. We would like to add this to Bitcoin Core. Covenants.
This all started from a very basic and simple observation about the current status of our computing infrastructure. The observation is that the state of our computing infrastructure is no where near safe enough to store assets like bitcoin.</description></item></channel></rss>
