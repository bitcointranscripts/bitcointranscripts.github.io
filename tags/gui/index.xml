Design team has put a lot of effort into constructing UI, including multisig and other features Goal: get parity to current UI. One-to-one, plus more There is a well documented &amp;lsquo;design framework&amp;rsquo; that goes with this, including Figma toolkits Design framework allows people to expand the featureset in a natural way, from a design-first way, which reduces engineering work Mobile-friendly designs available.
