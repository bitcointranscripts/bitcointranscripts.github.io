Q&amp;amp;A
Current GUI and QML progress seems slow? Code review / build system involvement? Will there be a test suite? Test suite yes, No fuzzing planned Why not RPC based? RPC not currently capable of building this UI on top of Is there a QML dependency graph? More dependencies required for sure May have to abandon depends approach Blocking calls historically an issue A consideration, but more to talk about here Integrated GUI Cost/Benefit Slides</description></item><item><title>Covenants Part 2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants-part-2/</guid><description>Introduction Christoph Ono: 00:00:01
All right, welcome to our second learning Bitcoin and Design call about covenants. Today, the idea was to go deeper into covenants use cases, right? Last time, the first call was more about just generally what it is and what it does. Now we wanted to go deeper. I think on the web, on the GitHub issue, there was one request about congestion control. But the other big one was scaling, I think.</description></item><item><title>Covenants</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants/</guid><description>Introductions Christoph Ono: 00:00:01
Welcome to our first Learning Bitcoin and Design call of 2024. We haven&amp;rsquo;t had one of these in a while, but we&amp;rsquo;re picking them back up again. The first topic is a really tough one, I think at least, it&amp;rsquo;s covenants. The reason, one of the reasons why this came up is because on Bitcoin Design, we have this new design challenge. We have a page with design challenges that are meant to be kind of take home challenges.</description></item><item><title>Translational Bitcoin Development</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/translational-bitcoin-development/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/translational-bitcoin-development/</guid><description>Introduction This is called Translational Bitcoin Development or Why Johnny Can&amp;rsquo;t Verify. So quick intro, I&amp;rsquo;m Tadge Dryja. Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on in Bitcoin over the last decade is the Bitcoin Lightning Network paper, the Discreet Log Contracts paper, Utreexo, and building out a lot of that software. In terms of places I&amp;rsquo;ve worked, Lightning Labs, founded that, and then MIT DCI is where I used to work for a couple years and now I&amp;rsquo;m at a company called Lightspark.</description></item><item><title>Channel Jamming on the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/channel-jamming-on-the-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/channel-jamming-on-the-lightning-network/</guid><description>Clara and Sergei stop by to chat about their recent proposal on mitigating jamming attacks in the Lightning Network.

All right. Welcome, everybody. This is the Learning Bitcoin and Design Call. It&amp;rsquo;s July 26, 2022. And our topic this week is FediMint. And we have Justin Moon here with us and several designers and product folks in the room here that are interested in learning about this. So I&amp;rsquo;ve got a FigJam open here where we can toss images, ideas, text, links, whatever we want to consolidate during the call.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Excel Plugin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-26-pierre-rochard-lightning-excel-plugin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-26-pierre-rochard-lightning-excel-plugin/</guid><description>Demo My project is to create a user interface for lightning that might appeal to a different crowd than ours. We’re kind of used to Linux, open source, free software so being in a proprietary environment like Excel is unfamiliar territory for us. And yet I think that there is a large demographic of people who are interested in Bitcoin who work in the business world where they use Excel day to day.</description></item><item><title>Designing Lightning Wallets for the Bitcoin Users</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/lightning-wallet-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/lightning-wallet-design/</guid><description>Good morning everyone. Thank you for being here. Thank you to the organizers for this event. My talk is about designing lightning wallets for bitcoin users. I am talking about UX. But really, UX is a lot more than what wallets look like. It&amp;rsquo;s from bip39 and making backups much easier, to anything you cna imagine, to make it easier for bitcoin to use bitcoin.
