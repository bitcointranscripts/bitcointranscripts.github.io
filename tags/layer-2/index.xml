Introduction Thank you, good morning everybody. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about our latest version of our Abitrum system. The first version was discussed in a paper in 2018. Since then, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of advances in my technology and a real running system has been made. This is the first working roll-up system for general smart contracts.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Lightning Network Developments - with Igor Korsakov</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/2022-01-26-igor-korsakov-cool-ln-developments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/2022-01-26-igor-korsakov-cool-ln-developments/</guid><description>Name: Igor Korsakov

Synonym Igor Synonym is a company that John Carvalho started and he is trying to put Web3 inside of Bitcoin. But what it consists of? They&amp;rsquo;re using several things like identities and people hosting their own data.
AOPP For identity, the first thing I want to mention is Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP). This is the field that we added in BlueWallet some months ago.</description></item><item><title>Drivechain Paul Sztorc (2019-05-27)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-05-27-drivechain-paul-sztorc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-05-27-drivechain-paul-sztorc/</guid><description>2019-05-27

Our next talk is getting into layer 2. Leaving hwat needs to done at th&amp;hellip;
I am going to start with maybe a simple beginning talking about a single channel between Alice and Bob. We heard about channels yesterday so I am not going to go into details. Alice is not going to cheat Bob in my scenario. Everything is going to run as if everyone honest and doing their best effort, for my example.</description></item><item><title>Incentives Tradeoffs Transaction Selection In Dag Based Protocols</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/incentives-tradeoffs-transaction-selection-in-dag-based-protocols/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/incentives-tradeoffs-transaction-selection-in-dag-based-protocols/</guid><description>Incentives and Trade-offs in Transaction Selection in DAG-based Protocols
Yonatan Sompolinsky (The Hebrew University)
Commercial effort to implement DAG-based protocols. No ICO, it&amp;rsquo;s a regular company.
A little bit background of DAG-based protocols. The background to this work is something we have been working at Hebrew University and Yoad. This idea of blockDAG is about layer 1 of bitcoin. And so it&amp;rsquo;s a generalization of the chain structure of blockchain. As such, there are two solutions- lightning network and payment channels, and were scaling up layer 1, and you&amp;rsquo;re scaling up in layer 2, it&amp;rsquo;s complementary solutions.</description></item><item><title>Joi Ito</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/joi-ito/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/joi-ito/</guid><description>Joi Ito
Welcome back to Scaling Bitcoin day 2. I am sure everyone went home and tried Ethan&amp;rsquo;s wagering setup yesterday. Today we are going to be covering topics like layer 2, fees, and consensus. To get us started today, we have a very special guest, Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, and he will be talking about parallels to the internet and ICOs and he will cover a lot of ground.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Topological Analysis</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-topological-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-topological-analysis/</guid><description>Topological analysis of the lightning network

Introduction Knowing the topology is not necessarily a vulnerability, but it gives you a lot of information. If I know Bryan&amp;rsquo;s full node is connected to some other nodes, I will have an easier time to cut Bryan out of the network or launch attacks against him. Knowing the topology is not necessarily a vulnerability, but it&amp;rsquo;s really strong information.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Overview</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/lightning-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/lightning-overview/</guid><description>Lightning overview

Introduction First I am going to give a brief overview of how lightning works for those of who you may not be so familiar. Then I am going to discuss three technologies we&amp;rsquo;ll be working on in the next year at Lightning Labs and pushing forward.
Philosophical perspective and scalability Before I do that though, following up on what Neha was saying, I want to give a philosophical perspective on how I think about layer 2 as a scalability solution.</description></item><item><title>Lower Bounds Limits Plasma</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/lower-bounds-limits-plasma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/lower-bounds-limits-plasma/</guid><description>Lower Bounds for Off-Chain Protocols: Exploring the Limits of Plasma

Introduction Okay, thank you. The title of my talk is exploring the limits of plasma. This is joint work with others.
Plasma Let me start by telling you about Plasma. It&amp;rsquo;s a family of layer 2 solutions for scaling blockchain. It was proposed in 2017 by Poon and Buterin. It&amp;rsquo;s a family of protocols. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of different plasmas.</description></item><item><title>Optimistic Vm</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/optimistic-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/optimistic-vm/</guid><description>The optimistic VM

Introduction Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get started our afternoon session. Our first talk I am very happy to introduce our speaker on optimistic virtual machines. Earlier in this conference we heard about optimistic roll-ups and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this talk on optimistic virtual machines which is an up-and-coming approach on doing this.
Why hello everyone. I am building on ethereum and in particular we&amp;rsquo;re going to make Optimism: the attitude that will save the day.</description></item><item><title>Plasma Cash</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/plasma-cash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/plasma-cash/</guid><description>Plasma Cash: Towards more efficient plasma constructions

Introduction This is joint work with my collaborators. Permissionless blockchains have some issues. The permissionless nature leads to the transaction rate that they have. This limits widespread adoption of blockchain technology like bitcoin or ethereum. Scalability approaches can be roughly grouped into two groups, one is on-chain layer 1 solutions. The other group is off-chain layer 2, which is the focus of this talk today.</description></item><item><title>Statechains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/statechains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/statechains/</guid><description>Statechains: Off-chain transfer of UTXOs
Ruben Somsen
I am the education director of readingbitcoin.org, and I am going to be talking about statechains for off-chain transfer of UTXOs.
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1048799338703376385
Statechains This is another layer 2 scaling solution, by avoiding on-chain transactions. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to lightning network. The difference is that coin movement is not restricted. You deon&amp;rsquo;t have these channels where you have to have a path and send an exact amount.</description></item></channel></rss>
