Threshold signatures
I want to tell you what threshold signatures are and I want to convince you that threshold signatures are a technology you need. This is collaborative work.
There are three things I want to tell you today. The first is that the banking security model has been very very refined and has sophisticated techniques and process and controls for ensuring security. It does not translate to Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Signatures Group</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/w3-blockchain-workshop-2016/deterministic-signatures-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/w3-blockchain-workshop-2016/deterministic-signatures-group/</guid><description>Deterministic expressions (group)

Probably what people are least familiar with is crypto conditions. I am going to say a tiny bit about it.</description></item><item><title>Threshold Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/threshold-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/threshold-signatures/</guid><description>Efficient distributed key generation for threshold signatures
Mahnush Movahedi
Threshold signatures Threshold signature schemes are schemes where n parties and at least t are necessary and sufficient for signing. They want to make sure that t parties are necessary. Any threshold signature scheme typically has 3 protocols: key generation, signing, and verifying.
In key generation, one party creates a group public key as an output. Also, for each node that participates in the protocol, the protocol should output a secret key.</description></item><item><title>Threshold Signatures And Accountability (2019-02-04)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-02-04-threshold-signatures-and-accountability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-02-04-threshold-signatures-and-accountability/</guid><description>Threshold signatures and accountability

Sorry for the delays. We&amp;rsquo;re finally ready to talk. Welcome to our talk. We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank our sponsors including Blockstream and Digital Garage. Today we have Andrew Poelstra to talk about threshold signatures and accountability. He is known for working on mimblewimble, Bitcoin Core, libsecp256k1, and at Blockstream. Thank you.
Introduction Cool, thank you Mark for that introduction. Sorry about the delays. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.</description></item></channel></rss>
