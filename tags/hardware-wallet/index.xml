I&amp;rsquo;m Pavel Rusnak, known as Stik in the Bitcoin community. I&amp;rsquo;m the co-founder of Satoshi Labs, the company that brought Trezor. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about the challenges of implementing CoinJoin in hardware wallets.
Why Privacy Let&amp;rsquo;s summarize why privacy matters. Among all reasons I consider these reasons as most important.
Autonomy: Privacy allows individuals to have control over their personal information, enabling them to make independent choices and decisions.</description></item><item><title>HD Wallets, Mnemonic codes and SeedQR</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/hd-wallets-mnemonic-codes-and-seedqr/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/hd-wallets-mnemonic-codes-and-seedqr/</guid><description>Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:19

Live from Utrecht this is The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. Hello! Are you running the BIP8 True independent client yet?
Sjors Provoost: 00:01:56
Negative. I did not even know there was one.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:59
One has been launched, started. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s actually a client yet, a project has started.
Sjors Provoost: 00:02:05
Okay, a project has started, it&amp;rsquo;s not a binary or a code that you can compile.</description></item><item><title>Why do hardware wallets not support altcoins?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-11-01-greg-maxwell-hardware-wallets-altcoins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-11-01-greg-maxwell-hardware-wallets-altcoins/</guid><description>They&amp;rsquo;re an enormous distraction and hazard to software development. It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough to correctly and safely write software to support one system. Every minute spent creating and testing the software for some alternative is a minute taken away from supporting Bitcoin.
I can say first hand that my efforts to review hardware wallet code against possible vulnerabilities have been actively thwarted by hardware wallet codebases being crapped up with support for altcoins.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets in Bitcoin Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>Slides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k02o32d0pagac4r/Andrew%20Chow%20slides.pdf

Introduction Hey everyone. As you may have guessed I’m Andrew Chow. I’m Engineer at Blockstream and I also work on Bitcoin Core a lot, mostly in the wallet. I am going to be talking about hardware wallets and a bit history with them in Core and also how to integrate them in Core and how we are integrating them into Core.</description></item><item><title>Coldcard Mk3 - Security in Depth</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2019/2019-09-14-rodolfo-novak-coldcard-mk3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2019/2019-09-14-rodolfo-novak-coldcard-mk3/</guid><description>Intro My name is Rodolfo, I have been around Bitcoin for a little while. We make hardware. Today I wanted to get a little bit into how do you make a hardware wallet secure in a little bit more layman’s terms. Go through the process of getting that done.

Introduction We have 30 minutes. This was a talk by me and Jimmy but Jimmy talked for like 5 hours yesterday so I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking today.
Imagine you want to start working in bitcoin development. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance you will end up using a hardware wallet. In principle, it&amp;rsquo;s not any different from other software development. There&amp;rsquo;s still programming involved, like for firmware. Wallets have certain features and nuances compared to software wallets.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar 2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-08-22-socratic-seminar-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-08-22-socratic-seminar-2/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1164710800910692353
Introduction Hello. The idea was to do a more socratic style meetup. This was popularized by Bitdevs NYC and spread to SF. We tried this a few months ago with Jay. The idea is we run through research news, newsletters, podcasters, talk about what happened in the technical bitcoin community. We&amp;rsquo;re going to have different presenters.
Mike Schmidt is going to talk about some optech newsletters that he has been contributing to.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-06-29-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-06-29-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1145019634547978240

How much should Bitcoin Core do, and how much should other libraries do? Andrew Chow wrote the wonderful HWI tool. Right now we have a pull request to support external signers. The HWI script can talk to most major hardware wallets because it has all the drivers built in now, and it can get keys from it, and sign arbitrary transactions. That&amp;rsquo;s roughly what it does. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of manual, though.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets (History of Attacks)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-05-01-stepan-snigirev-hardware-wallet-attacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-05-01-stepan-snigirev-hardware-wallet-attacks/</guid><description>Slides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/64s3mtmt3efijxo/Stepan%20Snigirev%20on%20hardware%20wallet%20attacks.pdf

Introduction This talk is the second in the series after my previous talk in London a few months ago at the Advancing Bitcoin conference. There I was talking mostly about general attacks on hardware, more from the theoretical perspective. I didn’t say anything bad hardware wallets that exist and I didn’t specify anything on the bad side. Here I feel a bit more free as it is a meetup not a conference so I can say bad things about everyone.</description></item><item><title>Are Hardware Wallets Secure Enough?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2019-02-01-andreas-antonopoulos-hardware-wallet-security/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2019-02-01-andreas-antonopoulos-hardware-wallet-security/</guid><description>Q - Hi Andreas. I store my crypto on a Ledger. Listening to Trace Mayer this week has me concerned that this is not safe enough.

What is the gold standard for storing crypto for non-technical people? Is a hardware wallet good enough?</description></item><item><title>Wallet Security, Key Management &amp; Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/wallet-security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/wallet-security/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1049813559750746112
Intro Alright, I’m now going to talk about bitcoin wallet security. And I was asked to talk about key management and hardware security modules and a bunch of other topics all in one talk. This will be a bit broader than some of the other talks because this is an important subject about how do you actually store bitcoin and then some of the developments around the actual storage of bitcoin in a secure way.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core and hardware wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-09-19-sjors-provoost-core-hardware-wallet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-09-19-sjors-provoost-core-hardware-wallet/</guid><description>Topic: Using Bitcoin Core with hardware wallets

Hello. Nobody cares? Ah. So next up is Nicolas. And he will talk about hardware attacks. Thank you.
Introduction Hi everybody. Thanks for making a great conference so far. I am Nicolas from Ledger hardware wallet. Today I am going to be talking about breaking hardware wallets. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean physically breaking them. If you expected to come steal a hardware wallet and be able to break it, then you will be disappointed.</description></item><item><title>Extracting Seeds From Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/extracting-seeds-from-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/extracting-seeds-from-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>7DC5A359D0D5B5AB6728&amp;hellip;

Introduction My talk is about extracting seeds from hardware wallets. I am chief security officer at Ledger. I joined Ledger a bit more than one year ago. I built the Ledger Donjon which is an independent red team. Our mission is to help secure Ledger&amp;rsquo;s products. So what we do day to do is try to break all the hardware wallets. We continuously challenge the security of our products.</description></item><item><title>The Future Of Bitcoin Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-future-of-bitcoin-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-future-of-bitcoin-wallets/</guid><description>1 on 1: The future of bitcoin wallets

GZ: Thank you very much. We&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the future of bitcoin wallets. As you know, it&amp;rsquo;s a very central topic. We always compare bitcoin to the internet. Wallets are basically like browsers like back at the beginning of the web. They are the first gateway to a user experience for users on bitcoin. It&amp;rsquo;s important to see how they will evolve.</description></item><item><title>The Future of Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/future-of-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/future-of-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>D419 C410 1E24 5B09 0D2C 46BF 8C3D 2C48 560E 81AC

Introduction We are making a secure hardware platform for developers so that they can build their own hardware wallets. Today I want to talk about certain challenges for hardware wallets, what we&amp;rsquo;re missing, and how we can get better.
Current capabilities of hardware wallets Normally, hardware wallets keep keys reasonably secret and are able to spend coins or sign transactions.</description></item></channel></rss>
