Right now in the Lightning Network, if I were to make a payment every single hop along that route, they would know that they&amp;rsquo;re on the same route, because every single HTLC uses the same hash. It&amp;rsquo;s a bad privacy leak. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a much worse privacy leak now that we have multi-path payments, because every single path along your multi-path payment uses the same hash as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
