Welcome to Bitcoin Explained, the podcast with the most boring name in Bitcoin. Hey Sjors.
Sjors: 00:00:27
What&amp;rsquo;s up? What&amp;rsquo;s with the new name?
Aaron: 00:00:29
So We&amp;rsquo;ve rebranded our podcast. What do you think?
Sjors: 00:00:33
Well, I think, you know, especially if you read it correctly, Bitcoin, explained. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing name. I think the problem was that a lot of people have no idea what the hell a Van Weerdam Shores Nado is.</description></item><item><title>Chaincode Decoded: Bech32m</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/chaincode-decoded-bech32m/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/chaincode-decoded-bech32m/</guid><description>This revisits a segment we call Chaincode Decoded.

Live from Utrecht this is the Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. So the other day I wanted to send Bitcoin to someone, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
Sjors Provoost: 00:01:52
Why? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you hodl?
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:55
I hodl all I can, but sometimes I need to eat, or I need to pay my rent, or I need to buy a new plant for my living room.

bech32 design Bech32 is designed for human use and basically nothing else, the only consideration for QR codes is that all caps is also permitted.
For all your talk of human considerations you give a strong signal of having seldom actually used bitcoin addresses as a human. 1/3 type addresses are full of visually confusing characters and the case modulations are a pain to read and enter correctly.</description></item><item><title>New Address Type For Segwit Addresses</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-03-29-new-address-type-for-segwit-addresses/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-03-29-new-address-type-for-segwit-addresses/</guid><description>Topic: Bech32 addresses for Bitcoin

Intro Can everyone hear me fine through this microphone? Anyone who can&amp;rsquo;t hear me please raise your hand. Oh wait. All good now? Tonight I will be speaking on a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on on and off for the past year or so, which is the question of what kind of addresses we will be using in Bitcoin in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
