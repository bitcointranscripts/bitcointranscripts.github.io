Live from Utrecht this is the Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. So the other day I wanted to send Bitcoin to someone, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
Sjors Provoost: 00:01:52
Why? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you hodl?
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:55
I hodl all I can, but sometimes I need to eat, or I need to pay my rent, or I need to buy a new plant for my living room.
