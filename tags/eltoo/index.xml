They emphasize the importance of simplicity and robustness in the protocol, noting how attempts to increase fairness often complicate the system. Russell highlights the ongoing need for improvements in privacy and robustness, pointing out that while these areas aren&amp;rsquo;t usually urgent, they are crucial for long-term stability. They discuss the LN symmetry (formerly Eltoo) proposal, which aims to simplify the protocol by eliminating penalties for unintentional errors, thus making the network easier to maintain. The conversation also touches on the challenges posed by recent fee spikes and the need for better fee management and protocol upgrades. They conclude by acknowledging the significant progress made and the continuous efforts required to keep improving the network</description></item><item><title>Lightning History and everything else</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-history-and-everything-else/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/lightning-history-and-everything-else/</guid><description>Tadge Dryja chats with us about writing the Lightning Network paper and working in the Bitcoin space.</description></item><item><title>SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, ephemeral anchors and LN symmetry (ELTOO)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/sighash-anyprevout-ephemeral-anchors-and-ln-symmetry-eltoo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/sighash-anyprevout-ephemeral-anchors-and-ln-symmetry-eltoo/</guid><description>Greg Sanders joins us to discuss ANYPREVOUT, ephemeral anchors and LN symmetry (a.k.a.

Stephan Livera (SL): Christian welcome back to the show.
Christian Decker (CD): Hey Stephan, thanks for having me.
SL: I wanted to chat with you about a bunch of stuff that you’ve been doing. We’ve got a couple of things that I was really interested to chat with you about: ANYPREVOUT, MPP, Lightning attacks, the latest with Lightning Network.</description></item><item><title>Eltoo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</guid><description>Eltoo: The (Far) Future of Lightning

Intro Who has never heard about eltoo? It is my pet project and I am pretty proud of it. I will try to keep this short. I was told that you all have seen my presentation about the evolution of update protocols. I will probably go pretty quickly. I still want to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions if they have any.</description></item><item><title>Blind statechains: UTXO transfer with a blind signing server</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-statechains/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-statechains/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136992734953299970

Introduction I am going to talk casually through the whole statechains thing. If you want to interject, please do. I&amp;rsquo;ll get started. The current idea is to make it completely blind. It&amp;rsquo;s blinded statechains. The goal is to allow people to transfer a UTXO without changing anything on-chain. The concept I use to describe it is a blind signing server.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Channel Factories</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-14-christian-decker-channel-factories/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-14-christian-decker-channel-factories/</guid><description>Lightning topology limitation Stephan: Christian, welcome to the show.

Introduction Hi. Good morning. I am Zeta. I am going to talk about how to incentivize payment channel watchtowers. This is joint work with my collaborators.
Micropayment channels There are many ways to construct channels such as lightning channels and duplex channels. There&amp;rsquo;s hops, you can route payments, and other proposals more recent ones for doing channels in payment networks like sprites, eltoo, all of them although they are different they all share the fundamental nature of channels.</description></item></channel></rss>
