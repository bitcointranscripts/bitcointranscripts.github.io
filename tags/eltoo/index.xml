Intro Who has never heard about eltoo? It is my pet project and I am pretty proud of it. I will try to keep this short. I was told that you all have seen my presentation about the evolution of update protocols. I will probably go pretty quickly. I still want to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions if they have any.</description></item><item><title>Blind statechains: UTXO transfer with a blind signing server</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-statechains/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-statechains/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136992734953299970

Introduction I am going to talk casually through the whole statechains thing. If you want to interject, please do. I&amp;rsquo;ll get started. The current idea is to make it completely blind. It&amp;rsquo;s blinded statechains. The goal is to allow people to transfer a UTXO without changing anything on-chain. The concept I use to describe it is a blind signing server.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Channel Factories</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-14-christian-decker-channel-factories/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-14-christian-decker-channel-factories/</guid><description>Lightning topology limitation Stephan: Christian, welcome to the show.

Christian: Thank you so much for having me Stephan. I am a long time listener and I am happy to be joining you today.
Stephan: There has been a lot of chatter in the Bitcoin community on what might happen in the future. One of the ideas you presented in one of your papers you wrote in 2016 called Scalable Funding of Bitcoin Micropayment Channel Networks That is the discussion where we are going to go.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing Payment Channel Watchtowers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/incentivizing-payment-channel-watchtowers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/incentivizing-payment-channel-watchtowers/</guid><description>Incentivizing payment channel watchtowers

Introduction Hi. Good morning. I am Zeta. I am going to talk about how to incentivize payment channel watchtowers. This is joint work with my collaborators.
Micropayment channels There are many ways to construct channels such as lightning channels and duplex channels. There&amp;rsquo;s hops, you can route payments, and other proposals more recent ones for doing channels in payment networks like sprites, eltoo, all of them although they are different they all share the fundamental nature of channels.</description></item></channel></rss>
