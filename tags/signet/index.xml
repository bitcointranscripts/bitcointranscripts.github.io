This is how you can become Signet-rich.
First, we should probably do an overview of the various network types. Everybody knows about Mainnet. This is what we use day to day, but there&amp;rsquo;s a few other testing networks. RegTest, or SimNet, if you are running BTCD, is a local unit testing framework.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core 0.21.0</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v0-21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v0-21/</guid><description>Intro Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:35
Live from Utrecht, this is The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. Episode 24, we&amp;rsquo;re going to discuss Bitcoin Core 21.
Sjors Provost: 00:01:46
Hooray. Well, 0.21. We&amp;rsquo;re still in the age of the zero point releases.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:51
Yes, which is ending now.
Sjors Provost: 00:01:53
Probably yes.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:54
That&amp;rsquo;s what I understand. The next one, the 22 will actually be Bitcoin Core 22.</description></item><item><title>Explaining Signet</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/explaining-signet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/explaining-signet/</guid><description>Intro Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:07

Sjors Provoost: 00:00:12
Thank you. It&amp;rsquo;s good to be back. Well, I never left, but&amp;hellip;
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:15
Yeah, well, we&amp;rsquo;re at your home now, so you never left, I think. You probably literally never left because of corona
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:21
Exactly we&amp;rsquo;re at my secret location

Intro Michael Folkson (MF): This is a Socratic Seminar organized by London BitDevs. We have a few in the past. We had a couple on BIP-Schnorr and BIP-Taproot that were really good with Pieter Wuille, Russell O’Connor and various other people joined those.</description></item><item><title>Signet Workshop</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-kalle-alm-signet-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-kalle-alm-signet-workshop/</guid><description>Video: No video posted online

If you don’t have the dependencies Google your OS and “Bitcoin build”.

Intro I am going to talk about Signet. Do you guys know what Signet is? A few people know. I will explain it briefly. I have an elevator pitch, I have three actually depending on the height of the elevator. Basically Signet is testnet except all the broken parts are removed.</description></item><item><title>Signet annd its uses for development</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/signet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/signet/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171310731100381184

Introduction I was going to talk about signet yesterday but people had some delay downloading docker images. How many of you have signet right now? How many think you have signet right now? How many downloaded something yesterday? How many docker users? And how many people have compiled it themselves? Okay. I think we have like 10 people. The people that compiled it yourself, I think you&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to do this.</description></item><item><title>Signet</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-signet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-signet/</guid><description>https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016734.html

Introduction I am going to talk a little bit about signet. Does anyone not know what signet is? The idea is to have a signature of the block or the previous block. The idea is that testnet is horribly broken for testing things, especially testing things for long-term. You have large reorgs on testnet. What about testnet with a less broken difficulty adjustment? Testnet is for miner testing really.</description></item></channel></rss>
