All right. Welcome, everybody. This is the Learning Bitcoin and Design Call. It&amp;rsquo;s July 26, 2022. And our topic this week is Fediment. And we have Justin Moon here with us and several designers and product folks in the room here that are interested in learning about this. So I&amp;rsquo;ve got a FigJam open here where we can toss images, ideas, text, links, whatever we want to consolidate during the call.</description></item></channel></rss>
