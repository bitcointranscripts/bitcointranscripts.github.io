All right, welcome to our second learning Bitcoin and Design call about covenants. Today, the idea was to go deeper into covenants use cases, right? Last time, the first call was more about just generally what it is and what it does. Now we wanted to go deeper.

But the other big one was scaling, I think.</description></item><item><title>Covenants</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants/</guid><description>We dig into what covenants are, how they work, and the different use cases.</description></item><item><title>FediMint</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/fedimint/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/fedimint/</guid><description>Introduction Speaker 0: 00:00:02

All right. Welcome, everybody. This is the Learning Bitcoin and Design Call. It&amp;rsquo;s July 26, 2022. And our topic this week is Fediment. And we have Justin Moon here with us and several designers and product folks in the room here that are interested in learning about this. So I&amp;rsquo;ve got a FigJam open here where we can toss images, ideas, text, links, whatever we want to consolidate during the call.</description></item></channel></rss>
