We haven&rsquo;t had one of these in a while, but we&rsquo;re picking them back up again.
And the first topic is a really tough one, I think at least, it&rsquo;s Covenant.
And the reason, one of the reasons why this came up is because someone, Dan, let me see, I don&rsquo;t even have this in my background here.
So Here on the Bitcoin design, we have this new design challenge.
We have a page with design challenges that are meant to be kind of take home challenges.
If you want to challenge yourself to assign something, there&rsquo;s something you can do.
And Dan added covenants for scale because someone tweeted about it.
Someone called Leishman, who is CEO of some Bitcoin company that I just forgot.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:00:58</p><p>But the&mldr;
River.
River?</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:01:00</p><p>I think River.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:01:01</p><p>Okay, cool.
And that post basically said, hey, we really need people to dig into this Covenant stuff from a design perspective.
So that kind of kicked that off a little bit.
And then we decided to create this learning call.
And I don&rsquo;t know how about how everyone else is on this topic.
Until a month ago or so, I basically heard about that it exists and that there were a bunch of technical proposals called CTV and whatever that basically make no sense if you hear them and you&rsquo;re not familiar with anything.
The term covenant didn&rsquo;t really tell, say anything.
Like I put alien covenant in the background because literally that&rsquo;s the only time in my life I think that I&rsquo;ve ever heard the term covenant.
Couldn&rsquo;t even figure out what that&rsquo;s supposed to do.
I did listen to some podcasts recently by Stefan Levera that were extremely helpful that have this great overview.
And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s actually that difficult after listening to those podcasts.
But then we&rsquo;re here in this call now that we can kind of shed some light on this stuff.
And then hopefully we can work towards maybe some of these design explorations and figure out how this technical mumbo jumbo can actually make Bitcoin more useful for more people and maybe address scaling.
I don&rsquo;t know, what is everyone else bringing into this conversation here?</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:02:30</p><p>Yeah, so I came across Covenant relatively early during or after my grant started because it&rsquo;s, I mean, it can help to improve the programmability of Bitcoin, of wallets, of transactions.
So in terms of kind of, let&rsquo;s say, automated inheritance or vaulting features that might be helpful.
But then I focus more on Miniscript, which is, can do something or something that exists today and can do something limited, similar, something similar.
So yeah.
And then components are like that on steroids with, kind of, yeah, on steroids basically.
So you can do much more advanced stuff with it.
But I didn&rsquo;t know about the scaling enigma thing at the time.
Just read that this week.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:03:42</p><p>Yeah.
Hey everyone.
Nice to see you guys.
I think my journey on this one has been pretty I think similar to Christoph&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s like so many abbreviations, so much like arcane stuff, like it seems so difficult to understand APOC TV CSFS.
I mean the abbreviations go longer and longer like they&rsquo;re like you know what&rsquo;s happening.
I think it&rsquo;s all very technical like it looks like there is there is a class of people mostly devs who are like interested in the in the digital money programmability side of Bitcoin.
And so they want to make it more technically useful, and you should be able to do different things, and all of that.
And basically, as Michael was saying about spending it in different ways and things like that and I think that&rsquo;s like a lot of the motivation like covenant so I think the original use case was voids so basically being able to specify different types of conditions that UTXO can be spent in and all of that stuff.
And this thing, I think, was pretty old.
This is from three, four years back, but in the last few months, I think it has picked up steam again with so many devs coming in.
My perspective on this is like, this is too technical and I love understanding all this stuff, but like as a designer, I&rsquo;m trying to think what are the use cases, what are the features that will help people and more like thinking not from the programmability point of view, but like scaling and privacy and those things, I think that is like something that we require nowadays, like in 2023, 2024.
And I think I&rsquo;m excited to see how it can help.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:06:04</p><p>I think it would be helpful if we take a step all the way back.
Because like you said, there&rsquo;s this programmability stuff and the dev conversations.
These all seem to be pretty much already sold in.
They&rsquo;re not even talking about what this thing is for.
They&rsquo;re just talking about how it can work.
And I&rsquo;m actually really glad Owen is here and also raising his hand.
Because I think just earlier I came across his two threads here, which I think you posted on GitHub or somewhere.
And those are really good explanations of what this stuff actually does.
So, and you just raised your hand, Owen, go ahead.
Yeah.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:06:43</p><p>Hi, I was asked to join this call.
I haven&rsquo;t joined a Bitcoin design call before, but it&rsquo;s good to get involved.
As you can see with those threads, I put a lot of thought recently into trying to visualize how this stuff works, because it&rsquo;s very difficult for people to wrap their heads around how these functions work and then what you can go on to do with them.
And it&rsquo;s not actually that alien or strange, it&rsquo;s just different to how we do things today.
But I started off with CTV because it&rsquo;s the most simple and sort of easy to rationalize about how it works and what you can do with it.
And then other forms of covenant are more flexible versions of that that I think might be wise to put to one side for the purposes of design stuff.
For now, the way you can think of CTV is a bit like.
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s quite similar to PSBT to having a pre-signed transaction where I could technically pay you by signing a transaction to spend my coins to your address and then just giving it to you rather than broadcasting it to the blockchain.
However, you still have to trust that I&rsquo;m not going to spend those coins differently first before you get it.
So you can&rsquo;t consider that PSPT a payment, right?
Because I could spend them any other way before you broadcast it and they&rsquo;re not your coins anymore.
So today we&rsquo;re using only the chain itself to log ownership changes.
And what covenants allow us to do are ownership changes off-chain as long as you can plan them in advance.
So there&rsquo;s a couple of use cases in those threads I gave.
If you haven&rsquo;t read them already, I highly recommend starting there.
And what, in the second thread, I got onto the actual use cases.
And the more I&rsquo;ve looked at this stuff, the more I&rsquo;ve realized there&rsquo;s kind of two basic principles that covenants are useful for here, you end up with these kind of meta primitives.
So technically speaking, it&rsquo;s what I said a minute ago about having a pre-signed transaction that I can&rsquo;t spend differently, so you can consider yourself paid as soon as you have it.
But the use cases tend to be vault type structures, which are kind of using the chain to trigger a time lock because in Bitcoin&rsquo;s technical design at the moment, we don&rsquo;t have ways where like a key expires in a multi-sig or something.
You can only make it more easy to spend.
You can&rsquo;t make it less easy to spend.
So vault type structures kind of allow you to trigger the start of the time lock, which is very useful.
And then the other one, which is where everyone&rsquo;s brain starts to melt are tree type structures, which is where you&rsquo;re kind of, you could think of it as aggregating lots of transactions together or like a zip file of lots of transactions that only represent on chain as one.
And it is difficult to think about this stuff, but these are the areas, particularly the tree stuff, that&rsquo;s where we can start doing scaling.
And that&rsquo;s what I think Alex was asking people to start thinking about the UX for, because it&rsquo;s just very different to how we do Bitcoin today.
But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s impossible.
I started to think about this stuff before I even got invited to this meeting.
And I have some ideas already, but I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to start working on them yet.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll stop talking for a minute and let someone else speak.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:09:54</p><p>Awesome, thanks.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:09:57</p><p>Sorry Christophe, I just wanted to say thanks Owen for joining in.
Those two Twitter threads are super duper useful.
I am happy that I&rsquo;ve gone through at least the first one a couple of times and I&rsquo;m still not completely there.
I think I have to read it again and try to do more research, but it was super, super, duper useful, man.
And thanks for joining.
I mean, I love that.
Thanks.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:10:25</p><p>Yeah, no problem.
And it felt like an area I could add some value to the conversation, because I recognized there was a lot of technical people that got hurt worked, and a lot of like us normal people who just can&rsquo;t understand how this stuff is useful at all yet.
And I spent, you know, the last six months or so, just gradually learning and learning about use cases and things.
So I could start visualizing how you can actually use this and explain it to people or we&rsquo;re never going to get anywhere with it.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:10:50</p><p>You know, we actually in the Bitcoin design guide, we have a whole section called how it works and it&rsquo;s very similar to what you put together there.
It&rsquo;s, you know, private key management, like here&rsquo;s a whole thing about how multi-key, you know, systems work.
Some of them have illustrations similar to yours, others don&rsquo;t.
Here&rsquo;s one about custom spending conditions with recovery paths, but it&rsquo;s the same idea what you did.
Just take these kind of complex things and translate them in our case for designers within the idea that then they can take that and then build products on top of them.
So maybe we could turn this into an AI workspace too.
Twitter threads kind of get forgotten at some point, if you&rsquo;d be open to that.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:11:40</p><p>Yeah, sure.
I mean, take whatever you think is useful from it.
I&rsquo;m happy to comment if you want as well.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:11:47</p><p>Awesome.
I wanted to take one step further back.
So as I said earlier, I didn&rsquo;t figure out what the word covenant means, but it&rsquo;s basically a promise to engage in some type of activity.
And I found that helpful in the Stefan Levera podcast where they basically said that with Brandon Black, I think, where they said, in Bitcoin, every coin has a restriction on how it can be spent.
But right now, it&rsquo;s basically you need to have the private key, right?
There&rsquo;s one rule how you can spend it.
It&rsquo;s the private key.
If you have that, you can spend it, right?
That&rsquo;s kind of the default that everyone knows.
Then the second one that Michael has been looking into a lot is the time locks.
You can spend it after a certain amount of time if you have a key.
And then the covenants, the idea there is to just really open that door much, much further, that you can have all kinds of complex predefined rules about how this can be spent by multiple people with different scenarios.
So I found that a pretty good starting point.
And then the other thing that I learned that was interesting is that the CTV and all of these abbreviations and all this stuff, they&rsquo;re all kind of trying to do the same thing technically, and they take different approaches that end up with slightly like some of them have like some are a little bit more complex, some a little bit easier.
Some of them have a little bit more flexibility, others are a little bit more rigid, but they&rsquo;re all kind of trying to do the same thing.
And then as you dig through those, and you probably end up with different use cases.
And one thing I found interesting, too, is that there seems to be a tendency, because the more complex proposals, they enable more, but they are more risky in terms of things that can go wrong, unforeseen circumstances and all of that.
So there seems to be more to it, tendency towards to the simpler ones get enabled.
So there were some takeaways that I found interesting that I wanted to add as well.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:13:53</p><p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a fair characterization and the simplicity.
This is why I started with CTV because it&rsquo;s the easiest to think about and it&rsquo;s the most tightly constrained, but it still unlocks a huge possibility space of interesting things we can do.
I use the word constructs because just a CTV by itself isn&rsquo;t that interesting but the stuff it allows you to do is more.
Then a lot of the developers I speak to are thinking, okay, we&rsquo;ll start with this, we can build a ton of useful stuff already, and then as we learn more familiarity with how to use these covenant type structures and so on, we can start to realize where we need a little bit more power and a little bit more flexibility and maybe add those in later on with another fork down the road.
But lots of people are very wary about, you know, opening Pandora&rsquo;s box and doing something really complicated on day one because there&rsquo;s, I mean, none of this stuff is going to break Bitcoin, but some of the stuff is just too complex to rationalize about what its limitations are, whereas CTV is quite tightly scoped and also very well studied.
It&rsquo;s been around many years now at this point.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:14:56</p><p>So a question there around the two use cases that you found.
So the multi-sig fall vault, I find that pretty easy and that seems like it&rsquo;s a user-facing thing.
You can just say, well, you know, these coins here, yeah, they can be spent, but before there, there&rsquo;s like a delay, basically, before they can be spent.
So if someone else tries to spend them, then they either can&rsquo;t do it or they have to wait.
So I&rsquo;m going to notice it.
I&rsquo;m going to get them into safety because everyone else has to wait.
So that&rsquo;s kind of user facing that&rsquo;s kind of easy to understand.
Then the scaling thing, that almost seems like it&rsquo;s something that users might never even see that could potentially be happened behind the scenes, right?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:15:42</p><p>Yeah, so this is where it starts to get complicated.
And I think it might be useful to think of it from the two different directions.
On the one hand, users might build these trees themselves.
That&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;ve got a number of payments you want to make to several different people for different reasons, but maybe not all of them right now, but you know, and I&rsquo;m gonna pay rent next month and the month after and the month after.
So maybe next time I get my salary arrive, I could construct a tree myself and that turns into just a regular receive address that I could give to the payroll company.
They pay to that address.
And I know I&rsquo;ve actually got my rent payments for the next six months kind of locked into the chain ready to go.
I don&rsquo;t need to make another on-chain transaction just by giving them that one address.
So that&rsquo;s an example of a user wanting to construct a tree.
And I can kind of picture in my head what a UX for that might roughly look like.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that difficult.
That&rsquo;s somewhat interesting.
But the interesting ones are where the tree structure is built by someone else, and it allows you to be paid inside that tree.
That&rsquo;s the really tricky one and that&rsquo;s where work needs to be applied.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:16:50</p><p>Gotcha.
So, in the first thing, so let&rsquo;s say I want to, right now, if I want to do six months of rent payments, I can basically make six different transactions and batch them.
But with this CTV, then I could basically bundle them all, compress them into like a single address or so, and then they would automatically be executed as time goes by.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:17:13</p><p>That&rsquo;s one way of doing it.
It&rsquo;s more, you see this stuff is difficult to even explain, even having written the thread about it.
Yeah, you can think of it as a compression thing.
And that address will contain, if you&rsquo;ve built it this way, will contain rules that, you know, I can only spend this many coins once per month or something like that.
And so I can make my rent payments by giving the pre-signed transaction to my landlord, basically, rather than having to actually send on chain, I can just give him this transaction and that is enough information for me to look at my address I created and see that he now has all the information necessary to spend that one month&rsquo;s rent worth of coins from it and I can&rsquo;t spend them anywhere else.
So what I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m just revealing some information to him and then he&rsquo;s able to claim them whenever he wants and he knows that I can&rsquo;t spend them any other way either.
So that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s useful for scaling because you&rsquo;re moving the ownership changes off-chain.
You&rsquo;re changing it from needing to stamp a transaction onto the blockchain to needing to just reveal some information to the counterparty that they didn&rsquo;t know before.
Once they receive that information, they know that they have all the information necessary to claim it and that I can&rsquo;t spend them in a different way.</p><p>Speaker 4: 00:18:32</p><p>I have a question.
So, sorry, my name is Mo from the Bitcoin design community.
I&rsquo;m the UX researcher here.
Very random jumping into the question.
I was just thinking for a very long time trying to piece everything together.
You said, so this code that they share allows the transaction to happen completely off chain.
So let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m the owner of the code, and then I hand that code over to you, and then we enter into an agreement for X amount of Bitcoin and then what is preventing you from actually spending, you gave that to me but how do I know that that amount of Bitcoin actually exists and that you don&rsquo;t just go spend it?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:19:18</p><p>So the address is encode the spending conditions for coins that end up there.
So at the moment, all the addresses you generate with your regular today&rsquo;s wallet will say, you&rsquo;re not allowed to spend these coins unless you present a signature from this private key, right?
That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re all used to.
In a world where we&rsquo;re using CTV, the address that you generate will say, you&rsquo;re not allowed to spend these coins unless you present a signature from this private key, right?</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:19:39</p><p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re all used to.
In a world where we&rsquo;re using CTV,</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:19:39</p><p>the address that you generate will say you&rsquo;re not allowed to spend these coins unless the spending transaction looks exactly like this that I&rsquo;ve predefined.
And so to the rest of the world on chain it just looks like some coins going to some address, but as soon as I show someone the spending transaction which would be you know sending coins to the landlord or whatever, then he is able to verify that that transaction, that spending transaction, is the only spending condition for that address.
So if he&rsquo;s not able to verify that, because maybe you&rsquo;ve got some secondary spending condition where Mikey can still spend it after two weeks or something, where you can try and rug pull.
If he&rsquo;s not satisfied that that spending transaction is the only way to spend those coins, which he can calculate for himself as soon as he had said information, then he should not consider himself paid.
So Maybe it might be easier to have a look at another example, which is the cold channel example, because that&rsquo;s a much more immediately visualizable, useful thing.
I mean, we can&rsquo;t read it in the background, Christoph, but Maybe you can scroll up a little bit, because that&rsquo;s easy to understand.
So the cold channel construct is something useful for lightning.
So at the moment, when you want to open a lightning channel, you need to deposit coins into the multisig address with the channel partner, and there&rsquo;s normally actually several stages of on-chain hops before then because you know you&rsquo;re getting paid your salary or something you&rsquo;re not going to have that sent straight to the lightning address because you and the channel partner need to negotiate in advance what the balance is going to be and get everyone to pre-sign all the revocation transactions, all that stuff.
So you don&rsquo;t tend to deposit straight into the Lightning Channel address today.
You tend to, maybe it goes to your cold storage first and then later on you decide you want to have some more liquidity and lightning, so you send it.
And then all the node packages tend to want you to send it into the nodes single custody first, so it can then do the negotiating stuff with the channel partner.
And then you want to when the negotiation stuff is agreed, do you then deposit coins into the channel address and then you can start using it.
But that&rsquo;s using several on-chain transactions just to get this off-chain transacting started.
With CTV, we can do this thing called a cold channel where using a couple of different spending routes, which are in one of the other slides, you can create an address that is a Lightning Channel already, but the counterparty doesn&rsquo;t know about it yet.
To everyone else in the world, it just looks like a regular deposit address.
Then you can leave it there for months, years.
No one else knows there&rsquo;s any way to spend it apart from it just looks like a regular signature address.
But when you decide you want to start spending those, you can reach out to that counterparty and say, hey, by the way, this address here, this was actually a Lightning channel between us the whole time.
And if they&rsquo;re responsive, then you can start using it like a regular channel without any more on-chain transactions happening at all.
So you don&rsquo;t need to move funds from that address into a channel address or anything.
It&rsquo;s already a channel address and All that needs to happen is you give a little piece of extra information to the channel partner and now he has everything necessary to start operating it as a regular channel with you.
So why that is interesting is not only does it cut out several on-chain transactions, but it also means that you can treat this as cold storage basically.
So you might as well receive all of your salary payments into these cold channels because you get like a free option to start using it as Lightning immediately at any time that you so wish without a security trade-off.
Whereas today, your channel partner knows all the channels that you have together, and that means that they have the opportunity to try and steal from you, because Lightning is this sort of like cooperative, but also adversarial protocol.
So you remove the adversarial element until you reveal the information to them.
So that, and that works because when you, when you give the counterparty the information about all the CTV structure, he can see that the only ways to spend this coin are either through Lightning, which is just two or two multi-sig, or through the secondary path you can take is the justice transaction route.
And he now knows that when you go that route, he will see a transaction on chain that starts a time lock where he can spend it immediately, but you can&rsquo;t.
So you can, all the parties can have enough information to just start treating that existing address as a channel without doing anything more on chain.
So you save a couple of transactions, but you also flip the incentives around.
And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really interesting.
Maybe there&rsquo;s questions?</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:24:27</p><p>Yeah.
Oh, and So I think what you said, it made a lot of sense.
I think it saves cost, and there is safety, and all of that stuff.
How do you think existing user flows will change if we deployed cold channels?
That&rsquo;s the first question.
The second is, are there any new user flows that are enabled by this and like of course the first question was how does it change the existing user flows like you know for example in Phoenix we have deposited on chain and then there is like you know like so there is that kind of a user flow where you have to deposit funds first.
But then the way that the Moon Wallet does it is that it like does these submarine swaps and kind of avoids it all together.
And so it seems like around, around the channel stuff, there are a bunch of like user flows, how would you say like CTV impacts those or improves those?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:25:32</p><p>So how I think it would look is first of all, you construct this cold channel by yourself without needing anyone else&rsquo;s cooperation.
You just need the channel partners, public key or something like that.
Something that they publish that isn&rsquo;t, isn&rsquo;t risky to them.
So this would probably be like an LSP and they would probably publicize that they do this because it gets them more liquidity.
So what I imagine the UX sort of flow would look like is you need to construct this address first of all, because you&rsquo;re going to give it to your payroll process, or your exchange or whoever to do the withdrawal to, so you would need to pick who the, who the channel partner is going to be, which LSP, which probably seems like a dropdown or something, you know, like Async or Zeus or whoever.
And then it seems like the wallet in the background would do all of the CTV construction stuff, because the user doesn&rsquo;t even need to see or care about any of that.
It&rsquo;s like a standard template that you would just deploy.
And then the outcome of that would just be an address that you just give to payroll or whoever, and it gets paid to.
And I think you would need to, in the sort of the wallet balance area of the app, I think you would need to keep these in a segregated spot because they need to be almost like unsealed or something to start using them on Lightning.
So you wouldn&rsquo;t want to just dump it into the regular like Lightning balance because you can&rsquo;t start spending them right now.
You need to, a step needs to happen between the receiving and the spending.
It&rsquo;s just that that step is, does not require a non-chain transaction, just requires communications with the LSP.
So it seems to me like you naturally end up with like a, like a cash account or something, which is your actual lightning available sats right now.
And then maybe like checking account or something, which is like sats that are available on lightning, but you need to unseal them first, or we need to come up with a term, you know, that makes sense to people, but They&rsquo;re ready to go, but you need to complete the communications loop first.
So they&rsquo;re sort of like reserves or something like that.
But the unsealing seems like it could just be a regular button or something that starts a communications loop with the LSP and you ping them and say hello are you awake and they go yeah we&rsquo;re still here everything&rsquo;s fine and then you go bang here you go this was actually a cold challenge with you the whole time you&rsquo;re happy to start spending it and they go yeah sure whatever and then you can move it into the available funds you know.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:28:01</p><p>So like would it like mean that wallets and even users might not have to think about an on-chain balance and a lightning balance as two separate things and they can just like start thinking about them as the one and the same thing?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:28:24</p><p>I&rsquo;m trying not to put my personal&mldr;</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:28:27</p><p>I think you would still have to basically top up this kind of, let&rsquo;s say, lightning balance.
It wouldn&rsquo;t just, it would just be immediate.
It would not be, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to deposit, but you would still have probably two different, let&rsquo;s say, buckets or balances.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:28:47</p><p>Yeah, I wonder whether these might actually replace the whole on-chain balance thing because that&rsquo;s not awfully useful in Lightning at the moment, right, because you need to go and make another $5 transaction to start actually using it.
Maybe these would just supersede the on-chain balance stuff.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:29:02</p><p>Right, because I think right now like in the Phoenix wallet, you like try to you know, make some transactions.
And like from the user perspective, it seems like at some random time, the wallet will tell you that no, now you like, like, you need to pay this $5 or something, and then we don&rsquo;t know that, like what&rsquo;s happening in the background is that the channel is being made larger and all of these things.
And what it seems like you might be saying is that we don&rsquo;t even have like the users will never have to think about that again.
And it will simplify like all of those all of those things those mechanics.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:29:42</p><p>Yeah in an ideal world I think so.
I mean there is still a trade-off to make So what we didn&rsquo;t talk about already is in the case where you&rsquo;ve got one of these cold channels, you deposit some funds there, and then you call the LSP that it&rsquo;s a channel with and say, I&rsquo;d like to start using it please, and they don&rsquo;t respond for whatever reason, then you need to basically move from that address to another one because as part of the assurances that you need to provide to the LSP that you&rsquo;re not going to rug them, that means that you, the only routes to spending the cold channel are the cooperative case, which is the multi-sig like now, or the like something&rsquo;s gone wrong and I need to move on case, which adds a time lock, which is how he&rsquo;s got an assurance that you can&rsquo;t rug pull him.
So if he doesn&rsquo;t respond, you do need to make an on-chain transaction and move to another address.
So we will still have to kind of factor that in.
But hopefully with a professional SP, this is a very rare occurrence like in the Phoenix situation.
You know, Phoenix is so tightly integrated with async, they&rsquo;re not ever going to be offline.
It shouldn&rsquo;t really ever be an issue, but you do need to have that in the back pocket somewhere like how you would resolve that.
But it should be quite rare and you know it&rsquo;s kind of no worse than today where you have an on-chain balance that you still can&rsquo;t use without spending some money on another transaction anyway.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:30:59</p><p>So like these funds I would still be able to spend them for some other purpose, but I would have to do something else.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:31:09</p><p>Yes, you need to make an on-chain transaction to kind of move out of the cold channel construct and into another address, which could be a different cold channel with a different LSP, like in one swoop.
It doesn&rsquo;t have to be moved out to like a regular private key address and then moved on again.
Like you can chain these things together because they&rsquo;re all just addresses on chain that don&rsquo;t need negotiation first.
Negotiation first.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:31:38</p><p>Sounds like we have two potential user flows we could mock up here.
One, the vault and then the cold channel one.
I&rsquo;d be really interesting to see some UI explorations on those, on exactly what we just talked about.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:31:51</p><p>I think that&rsquo;s a good starting point as well.
The really important work to do later is the tree stuff.
But it kind of makes sense to start small, because trees are ultimately tend to be made of these like, I mean a cull channel is basically a vault structure on top of with a multi-sig as well, it&rsquo;s just with different, you reshuffled who the parties are, but everything is basically either starting time locks or using keys to spend a different way.
So it might make sense to come back to the tree stuff later on because it&rsquo;s like just a bigger version of all the stuff that we&rsquo;re covering already.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:32:31</p><p>Yeah, I tried to understand the tree stuff.
There&rsquo;s a point where I just didn&rsquo;t get through it.
Especially once everyone&rsquo;s in their trees, how you have any assurances of anything in there.
But I don&rsquo;t know, how&rsquo;s everyone else doing with the tree stuff?</p><p>Speaker 4: 00:32:53</p><p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to sit in the tree right now and enjoy the view.
That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m feeling the trees right now.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:33:00</p><p>But what questions do you have?
What can we clarify, or what would you like to?</p><p>Speaker 4: 00:33:06</p><p>I think if I would, if it&rsquo;s, or I should plug in my laptop charger as well.
I think if it&rsquo;s explained in a more, like the way that you have an example, if someone gets paid, I would be more able to understand it if it&rsquo;s an actual mock-up in a user flow, it would make a bit more sense to me.
I&rsquo;m not, it&rsquo;s just not quite there.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:33:28</p><p>Which part?</p><p>Speaker 5: 00:33:31</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m gonna agree with what you just said, Morgan, and ask if someone could just step through a narrative.
Just tell the story of how this thing works with the rent.
Like the example, if I think, okay, I want to post-date a bunch of rent.
Is that a good place to start?
Like I&rsquo;ve talked with my landlord and I&rsquo;m going to stay in this apartment for a year but then all of a sudden the water heater goes and I have to move okay how would I how would I run that scenario at month six, even though I gave him a bunch of post-dated checks, how do I stop from month six to month 12 and move and not pay him until he fixes the water heater?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:34:30</p><p>Yeah, so I think the rent example was not a good place to start actually, and why I wanted to move to the cold channels, because I think once you understand that a cold channel is just an address, the same as any other address, but it has lightning like optional functionality, then you can start to see how that is a very useful thing for everyone to have for like every payment they receive from anything basically, because Lightning payments are just better if you can make it work.
And the main hurdle is that you need to get the SATs into Lightning in the first place.
And we&rsquo;re kind of removing that concern.
So rather than the landlord rent example, if you think of it as like, next time I make a withdrawal from an exchange, I&rsquo;m gonna, you know, I can only give them one address.
And let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re a dumb exchange that doesn&rsquo;t do lightning or anything yet.
They just do boring old on-chain transactions to one address and they&rsquo;re going to charge me 50 bucks to withdraw or something.
What I could do is withdraw to an address that is actually a tree of my own of which one branch is a big cold channel right now.
Another one is like my backup cold channel that I might start using in a couple of months or something, you know, just reserves.
And then another one is to my vault and that&rsquo;s like 50% of the withdrawal or something.
You can do all those three things in one go with one address that the exchange doesn&rsquo;t need to cooperate with at all or know anything about.
They don&rsquo;t care.
They just send SATs to an address and you&rsquo;re done.
So it&rsquo;s the lack of needing cooperation I think is what&rsquo;s very useful about these.
That you don&rsquo;t need them to know or understand what you&rsquo;re doing at all you&rsquo;re just all the clever stuff is happening on Bitcoin itself and this the person spending to you the payer just sees an address So this is complicated as you want.</p><p>Speaker 5: 00:36:18</p><p>This would be more like, okay, I got paid and I have a checking account and three savings accounts.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:36:24</p><p>Yeah, you could easily structure it that way.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:36:30</p><p>And you could probably even say that at the beginning of the, or when the payment comes in, it goes into the, into the checking account.
And from there, at the end of the month, whatever is left or a certain amount goes into, into a vault.
Two payments go to your children for their, I don&rsquo;t know, chocolate and stuff like that.</p><p>Speaker 5: 00:37:00</p><p>But if my child has been bad and they don&rsquo;t deserve the chocolate, can I reverse?
Can I switch it off?
This is the whole, we&rsquo;re getting at the essence of the covenant, the promise, and the promise being broken.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:37:15</p><p>Yeah, so one way you can think about that is you can have multiple different spend paths, which is true today.
You know, you think of a multi-sig, you could have a multi-sig that requires two or three to sign today, anytime, or one key, but I have to wait six months before I can spend it that way.
That&rsquo;s an example everyone&rsquo;s fairly familiar with.
You can do the same thing and have a CTV spend which is you must use the exact template transaction which is some goes to the kids, some goes to the landlord or whatever.
Or the alternative is maybe a multi-sig where the landlord and the kids and me.
That&rsquo;s maybe isn&rsquo;t a great example.
The point is you can, you can fuse these two things of like, you can have a templated path Or you can have a multi-sig path, and that multi-sig, you can think of that as like everyone having a veto vote, basically.
You know, we all have to agree.
If we all agree, then we can spend this pot of sats, however the hell we want.
Or if we don&rsquo;t agree, then we can all trust the template path because that&rsquo;s locked in and committed already.</p><p>Speaker 5: 00:38:20</p><p>I see.
Yeah, yeah.
So, again, I&rsquo;m staying with the narrative here.
So, my child did not do their homework, so they don&rsquo;t get the chocolate.
And my wife and I are on the multi-sig and we both agree, okay, no, he can&rsquo;t get the chocolate.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:38:41</p><p>Yes, it would work like that, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a great example and there&rsquo;s maybe more confusing than that.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:38:47</p><p>So, Owen, like I feel like with these covenants and like how it means like to make a promise and all of that stuff, like sometimes you might want to break like you know, like you want to be careful before you make a promise and so if you like do like this this something of this like a transaction structure and then you want to like don&rsquo;t want to do that So is it possible in like scenarios like this to like have this like to commit to something that I will do this, this and this but then have the option to say no I don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:39:31</p><p>Only if you&rsquo;ve built it that way.
So remember, the address encodes the spending conditions.
So you&rsquo;ve decided what conditions should apply for you to be able to move those coins.
And the covenant is almost more useful as a way to prove to someone else that I can&rsquo;t spin it any other way.
So maybe another example, and this is still a little bit abstract, it&rsquo;s not that useful by itself, but we can use it for payments between three people.
So we&rsquo;ve already covered the compression thing.
We can give this one address to the exchange and it has many different things inside it.
Imagine that there are three branches and they are each branch is owned by one particular person.
Alice, Bob, Charlie.
Let&rsquo;s say we set it up so that the template route is, you know, exactly one third goes to each member, but there&rsquo;s also a multi-sig route that must be three of three.
And that multi-sig route, you can spend to anywhere that you want.
So We can all fall back on the everyone gets exactly one third equally, because we know that that can&rsquo;t be removed unless we all agree.
But if we do agree, we can spend it any way we want.
So if Alice needs to pay Bob for something, and Bob needs to pay Charlie for something, and Charlie does something else for Alice, whatever, we can change the amounts.
It doesn&rsquo;t have to be one third to everyone.
It could be 90% to Alice and 10% to Bob and nothing to Charlie, as long as we all agree on that.
And if we all agree, we can sign a transaction to spend from that initial address we gave.
And then it moves on to spend to wherever we want, because we all agreed.
So, you know, that&rsquo;s not really that useful in the real world, but as a principle, maybe that explains better, like how this stuff can work.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:41:15</p><p>Yeah.
Yeah.
Like I, I just heard, like your example in detail, I think you&rsquo;re like absolutely right.
Like that&rsquo;s not exactly giving the picture of what CTV can do like it seems like in this case it would be CTV plus like some of the other taproot things and all of that and combine them to get this use case.
Like this flexibility, I think that&rsquo;s the point here.
Yeah?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:41:41</p><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not that useful by itself, but it&rsquo;s very powerful primitive when we combine it with other things that we have.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:41:50</p><p>Right.
Right, so I was thinking, trying to think about it in the lens of something that you mentioned earlier.
It&rsquo;s like, what are the new new use cases it enables?
How does it improve some of the existing use cases?
And like, what is like, you know, like, maybe it can do the exact same use case, but with improved privacy, or lower costs, or things like that.
So can we try to think about the use cases and CTV like in these three categories, just to be able to understand it and the applications in a more concrete way.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:42:40</p><p>Okay, so that example I just gave with the three people, that&rsquo;s a very small example of what&rsquo;s called a payment pool, or I kind of use the word tree sometimes because that&rsquo;s more like how it&rsquo;s actually structured.
But these can be scaled up to whatever size.
I mean, the limit is basically how large do you think you can reliably collaborate between people.
You know, like three sounds probably pretty easy, especially if you&rsquo;ve got no time constraints.
10, probably fine.
Theoretically, hundreds, I guess, if you&rsquo;re like not in a rush, maybe.
But also remember that those inside the tree structures, inside the CTV, they&rsquo;re just payments to addresses, and addresses can also be CTVs. So each of those can be like, each branch can be another tree in itself that you don&rsquo;t even need to know about or care about.
Like that payment to Alice might actually have had, you know, 500 branches coming off of it.
Some of them were vaults and some were cold channels and some were all sorts of other stuff.
So why this is powerful is because this allows us to scale Bitcoin significantly by pushing all this transacting off-chain but with on-chain level of assurances still.
And there have been some papers even demonstrating that, I mean, things get a little bit unwieldy for sure, but in theory you can do global scale with this stuff if you can have a tree with a million people in, which is done by using some timeouts and things to force roll over the particular time so that everyone can rely on stuff without having to get those million people to actually collaborate on everything.
So this is the scope of what we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:44:17</p><p>But we need to start small with things we can design right now for sure.
Yeah, yeah.
But it&rsquo;s like, I hear what you just said and I think, yeah, so this is like scalability and it improves privacy.
Like these use cases could be like, so if it&rsquo;s just like one UTXO shared by a dozen people, and then there is like a spend from that, you don&rsquo;t know who was the owner of the previous one and who&rsquo;s the owner of a new one and things like that.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:44:47</p><p>So right.
So with what you can surveil on chain, you&rsquo;re just seeing one UTXO and it we&rsquo;re all kind of familiar with it with lightning already where it&rsquo;s one UTXO on chain but it&rsquo;s owned by two people but the SATs in it you know when we when we broadcast the closed channel state and I have you know 5,000 fewer SATs you know that I&rsquo;ve paid them to the channel partner,
but you don&rsquo;t know where he sent them onto because I&rsquo;ve routed it through the whole Lightning network.
So that, you know, the privacy improves significantly.
And a simple way to think about it is that you have that effect but with more than two people inside that UTXO.
And you actually don&rsquo;t even know how many people are inside that UTXO.
So it could be two or it could be a million.
And there&rsquo;s kind of no real way to know.
So you kind of get a lot of privacy for free.
Not perfect, sure, but better.
You get the payments kind of flexibility stuff in the same way as we do with Lightning.
But I think that the most compelling case for CTV was the scaling stuff, which is what a lot of people didn&rsquo;t really understand until about six to 12 months ago, just because it&rsquo;s very abstract and hard to think about.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:45:52</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the picture mode.
Like the movie Inception, you can have a dream in a dream in a dream, right?
That&rsquo;s the forest for the trees.
Dream in a dream.
So that&rsquo;s, I found it actually a pretty, a pretty good visual in the tweet thread.
Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to definitely next week work on the vault thing because it&rsquo;s basically what I, in the hackathon, like a year and a half ago, worked on for the inheritance topics where you have a dead man&rsquo;s switch that keeps transactions from happening.
But you have to have previously kind of on-chain transactions for everything.
And you couldn&rsquo;t have something like really these time locks where you have, let&rsquo;s say two weeks or a month before to reclaim the funds.
So to an emergency address.
So that&rsquo;s definitely something that I&rsquo;m gonna work on.
But I had a question.
Can I already say if I have, let&rsquo;s say, one Bitcoin and if create a transaction or have a kind of a setup where if I spend less than 0.1 Bitcoin, then I need only one signature?
If I want to spend more, I need two or three.
So Is this something that, I mean, that would be also a use case for these kinds of things, no?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:47:37</p><p>Yes, so you can&rsquo;t do that today, but you could do that in a Covenants world.
That would look like having several different possible spend paths, one of which was a template of the spend must be 0.1 BTC to address A with key A and path 2 might be you need keys A and B and it goes to address C for 0.2 BTC or whatever.
You get the gist.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:48:01</p><p>Exactly.
So we have a reference design crystal right for for exactly this use case I think it&rsquo;s in one of the In the shared world.
So somewhere we have exactly that where you have The condition that if it&rsquo;s less than something, only one signature is enough.
But these are, I mean, these are the practical use cases, I&rsquo;d say.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:48:28</p><p>No, that&rsquo;s a different, that&rsquo;s assisted custody one, where you have an auto signer that signs transactions below a certain amount to facilitate low amount payments.
And then for larger amounts that you&rsquo;re not comfortable with being automatically approved, that&rsquo;s where you need to get your extra keys out but it&rsquo;s the same key configuration there&rsquo;s just the software kind of enforces them.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:48:54</p><p>So in that example you&rsquo;re kind of trusting the signer software or the custody partner or whatever to not sign if they don&rsquo;t meet your terms But this is what CTV kind of does is it allows us to take things that were previously trusted and make the chain be the only trusted thing instead, which is obviously an improvement for many things.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:49:15</p><p>Yeah, so I feel like I get some of this stuff, right?
So if I was just trying to diagram a few things here, I made lots of other diagrams here earlier today for explaining fiat over lightning with synthetic, you know, fiat and all of this stuff.
So I&rsquo;m just reusing those.
So, so here&rsquo;s my understanding.
So Alice comes up with a bunch of rules, right?
Like I can spend these Bitcoin after one, after two Bitcoin after one year.
But Charles, he can take, spend one of those Bitcoin after one month, and he can spend another one Bitcoin after two months, whatever the rules may be, right.
And then I kind of compress them and turn them into this address.
And then, you know, I tell Bob, Robert, who is my employer, So I give him this address, it looks like general address, like no one can just looks like an address.
And they&rsquo;re like, okay, here&rsquo;s your salary.
And then that means these Bitcoin here will be locked to the conditions saved in this address.
So now we have rules and we have bitcoins tied to them.
And from then on, all interactions with these Bitcoin are governed by these rules.
So but no one knows about those rules, only Alice does, right?
So my landlord, which is this guy here, Charles, I have to tell him about those rules, right?
So I have to give him an address.
And it&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s my address, there are two Bitcoin in there.
And here&rsquo;s a rule that I baked into this address, and Charles can verify from the address like that, that&rsquo;s actually accurate.
And there are no other rules, which are where Alice can secretly take things away.
And he&rsquo;s like, okay, cool, I can spend one of those Bitcoin next month and then another one in two months, right?
But that&rsquo;s it.
Like no one can change these rules anymore.
And we&rsquo;re all kind of tied to them.
And that&rsquo;s kind of it.
So that&rsquo;s my understanding.
How do we get here from trees and trees and billions of scale?
Maybe it needs another 400 diagrams.</p><p>Speaker 4: 00:51:16</p><p>This makes sense.
This makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:51:19</p><p>And another call probably.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:51:22</p><p>But does this one require CTV, Owen?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:51:27</p><p>Yes, because CTV is What&rsquo;s being used to say, you know, you can only spend one Bitcoin.
Today, you can do time locks, sure, but you can&rsquo;t constrain how much.
All you can do is completely unlock the address or not have it be spendable.
Whereas with CTV, you can say how it can be spent, which includes, well, in CTV is a specific type of covenant that is all the terms of the spending transaction are built in already.
So it&rsquo;s how much and where to.
But with some of the more flexible covenant ones, you can pick and choose which bits of the transaction you want to constrain.
But it&rsquo;s easier to think about if you&rsquo;re using CTV as a starting point, where it&rsquo;s just like, this is exactly how it must be spent and nothing else.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:52:09</p><p>I had one question on here, and that wasn&rsquo;t clear to me.
So Alice can say, here are the rules, right?
But what is the unique thing that only allows Charles to spend them?
Why cannot Alice not spend through those reels?
There has to be some secret that only Charles has where Alice can&rsquo;t give everyone else.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:52:30</p><p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s not that Charles can spend it.
It&rsquo;s that one Bitcoin can go to Charles&rsquo;s address after one month Okay,
so anyone who has this information can just broadcast it straight away.
Think of it like a PSP T that can&rsquo;t be spent differently The rule is the Bitcoin has to go to Charles&rsquo;s address.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:52:47</p><p>So Alice has to know Charles&rsquo;s address in advance when she comes up with those rules?</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:52:52</p><p>Yes.
So that&rsquo;s one of the kind of useful limiting factors of CTV because you can only bake as much in as you can kind of coordinate in advance.
That&rsquo;s what stops things from going completely off the rails.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:53:03</p><p>Okay, so we need a thing here, like, where Alice talks to Charles and says, give me some addresses.
And then she can bake those in the oven.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:53:24</p><p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll have to.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:53:25</p><p>And who knows what the addresses of the trousers are.
They might be just vault addresses or they might be regular keys, or they might be trees or they might be vaults or they might be cold channels or God only knows what he&rsquo;s doing with them.
But as far as you&rsquo;re concerned, it&rsquo;s just an address.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:53:39</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:53:42</p><p>Yeah.
Owen, I think we spent the whole hour like talking only about the CPU, and there are like a dozen more proposals and stuff.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:54:03</p><p>I lost the tail end of that question.</p><p>Speaker 2: 00:54:05</p><p>Oh, sorry.
I was asking about like, what about some of the other proposals like this is just all about CTP just about but what about LHANS and OPFALT and CSFS and there are so many of these, I don&rsquo;t even know what that is.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:54:28</p><p>You have to wait for the next tweet, Brad.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:54:32</p><p>LHANS packages CTV plus CSFS and something else to kind of make a suite of soft forks bundled into one that are particularly very useful for Lightning.
CSFS, just a way to think of it holistically is that CTV is the most constrained version because you specify everything, every element of the spending transaction in advance.
And CSFS and other proposals allow you to say, you know, maybe I constrain the amount, but not the destination, or vice versa.
But you&rsquo;re generally making it more flexible.
And then there&rsquo;s other technical differences, like exactly how they go about that inside the code, and which bit gets hashed when, and which bytes are used for that, whatever, and so on, which is way beyond me.
But from an object level, as far as we in the UX world are concerned, CTV is like everything must be defined in advance about how this gets spent, and other covenant proposals are, you can choose which elements you want to constrain and how.
But that makes a design space even larger.
So I haven&rsquo;t even started thinking about those yet.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:55:42</p><p>One of these things I seem to remember, and I hope I remember it correctly, is that you could leave out which UTXOs should be bent.
Because you don&rsquo;t know in advance.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:55:56</p><p>And that&rsquo;s any PrevOut I think APO.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:55:58</p><p>Yeah, probably.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a big design space.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:56:07</p><p>Yeah.
So I can&rsquo;t advise awfully much on anything else besides CTP at the moment, just because it&rsquo;s just even larger to think about.
I know any PrevOut is particularly useful for lightning because it allows you to, you don&rsquo;t need to keep holding on to all these old channel states just in case someone broadcasts a really, really old one.
You can just keep hold of the latest one in the case that the channel goes wrong and you have to force close it suddenly somehow.
The latest one is enough.
You can forget about everything else.
But I don&rsquo;t know how that is used in, you know, other more interesting covenant constructs yet.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:56:41</p><p>Right.
Yeah, probably you would, I mean, actually we would probably need to know what we want to do before we, and then only then can we say, okay, is CTV enough or do we need something else?
Or is, so probably reverse the reasoning there a bit because, Yeah.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:57:04</p><p>That&rsquo;s one of the arguments that gets made and why there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of discourse about this stuff, because some people want the really expressive forms, some people want the really limited forms of covenants, and I&rsquo;m in the camp of the really limited form Because there&rsquo;s already a lot of very interesting stuff we can build with it.
And we don&rsquo;t, we also know it&rsquo;s about as safe as you can get in terms of soft fork upgrade, because it&rsquo;s so limited in scope and well studied.
And then as we build more things with it, we can start to see where it doesn&rsquo;t quite do enough and then we have more confidence about what extra things we need to add without breaking stuff.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:57:41</p><p>Yeah, this was super helpful.
I really learned a ton today and from the threads.
It was really, really helpful.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:57:51</p><p>Yeah, for sure.
We should really throw some, we could do a design huddle where we actually just collaboratively just try to design some flows for it.
I mean, I&rsquo;m thinking about basic stuff where, you know, you look at your, you look at your coins in there.
I mean, you&rsquo;re going to have to look at your balance or your transactions.
And there has to be a little thing that says this one has extra rules attached.
And then you&rsquo;d have to somehow see those extra rules.
And then you would have to think of the whole backup flow that this, because this is off-chain data that it doesn&rsquo;t get lost.
Yeah.
Yeah.</p><p>Speaker 1: 00:58:27</p><p>We could also in a design huddle have these kind of real world use cases like the one with the rent and the one with something else and say and then we give that to Owen and he says we have a he makes the table with all the different government proposals and he said okay you can do that with any product or with all these different things.
So we can compare them.</p><p>Speaker 0: 00:58:58</p><p>Okay, and here in my background to wrap things up are some AI generated trees made of Bitcoin addresses.
At least that&rsquo;s what Mitrani thinks it looks like.
Looks more like broccoli.
But that can be our next topic.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:59:14</p><p>Hey, That&rsquo;s cool.</p><p>Speaker 6: 00:59:21</p><p>Yeah, I had a question and I got to know the idea of it, but I have a small question.
I know that all of this is off-chain, and how will he spend it?
Like the last, when the owner or whoever gets the amount.
And he can spend it like that, or he needs to go and convert it into on-chain, and then he can spend it.</p><p>Speaker 3: 00:59:50</p><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the million dollar question.
So this is where a lot of people get stuck, including like really smart developers and things because it&rsquo;s hard to visualize.
So you will eventually think of all the stuff you do with the covenants, the CTVs or whatever, as being able to, how far you can organize things in advance by collaborating and working together.
So, You know, I won&rsquo;t give an example, that&rsquo;s more confusing.
So there&rsquo;s only so far ahead that we can plan and collaborate and things can actually work.
So once you reach the end of that and you need to change the structure altogether or something, you will need to go on chain, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that every single member of the shared UTXO have to all exit out of the chain and then all start again.
You can work together and say, if you&rsquo;re doing a payment pull structure, and Bob wants to leave or something, Bob needs to do something he can&rsquo;t possibly do inside this structure anymore.
The rest of us can be like well I&rsquo;m fine still staying in here I don&rsquo;t need to get my own new TXO on chain and then organize pooling together again in another one.
Why don&rsquo;t the five of the rest of us will all just hop across at the same time that Bob exits and start another pool or join an existing pool somewhere else.
So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just the way we use Bitcoin today is kind of quite crude and simplistic and we need to start realizing that the Chain is for like logging commitments that you can&rsquo;t go back from, basically, rather than ownership transfers, because we can now achieve ownership transfers off chain, but there just comes a point where we will need to do something that we can&rsquo;t do off chain and we can capture that change in a non-chain transaction, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be splintering it into a million pieces and starting from scratch.
We can still collaborate to move from one tree to another.
But this is the stuff that&rsquo;s super hard to visualize, so I may not have explained anything at all.</p><p>Speaker 6: 01:01:50</p><p>Yeah.
Okay.
And one more question.
In the start, it was, you said that it&rsquo;s necessary that they respond back.
What was that about?</p><p>Speaker 3: 01:02:03</p><p>It&rsquo;s necessary that there&rsquo;s what, sorry?</p><p>Speaker 6: 01:02:07</p><p>Like when there will be the, like Alice has the rules, set up the rules, and there&rsquo;s a landlord.
So when it goes to him, he&rsquo;ll have to respond back, something like that.
Is that, I didn&rsquo;t get that idea.</p><p>Speaker 1: 01:02:30</p><p>Or I just like it.</p><p>Speaker 3: 01:02:31</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure I like, I wish I&rsquo;d never said this landlord example because I think it&rsquo;s more confusing.
Okay.
Christoph is showing some stuff on the screen.
Was it about that?
What&rsquo;s on the screen right now?</p><p>Speaker 0: 01:02:43</p><p>I think the idea, I think the question is like, what does Alice actually give him?
And it&rsquo;s, I mean, the understanding is she basically gives him a ready to broadcast transaction almost.
It&rsquo;s like, hey, here&rsquo;s information that you can broadcast, but it&rsquo;s not and, but you don&rsquo;t have to do it now.
And it&rsquo;s not valid right now.
But in a month, you can do so.
And then the landlord, Charles here, he just has to keep that transaction or that piece of information and then months later just plug it into his Bitcoin wallet and say hey you&rsquo;re broadcasted I want this to be executed and then the Bitcoin will be transferred.</p><p>Speaker 6: 01:03:24</p><p>Okay so he has to reply back to Alice that I want to use it?</p><p>Speaker 3: 01:03:29</p><p>No she she will give him this little chunk of information.
So think of it as if we were doing it with PSBT, with signed transactions.
You know, she could, if we weren&rsquo;t using covenants, she could give him a pre-signed transaction and say, look, here&rsquo;s everything you need to withdraw some coins from my address and send them to yourself, signed by me.
But he can&rsquo;t trust that because she could spend the coin differently before he broadcasts it, so he has to broadcast it now and get it mined for it to be sure that it&rsquo;s his.
But in a world of covenants, she can say, here is that same PSPT, but you can also see that the address they&rsquo;re in, I can&rsquo;t spend them any different way than by broadcasting this transaction that sends them to you.
So you&rsquo;re using the transaction as the key that opens the lock now, rather than just a regular key.
By doing that, he may not even need to bother broadcasting them at all until he needs to go and buy a car next year or something, because he knows they can&rsquo;t go anywhere.
They&rsquo;re effectively, they are his.
They&rsquo;re not able to be moved by anyone apart from him.
So although they&rsquo;re not in his address yet, he can consider them his because there&rsquo;s nowhere else they can go.</p><p>Speaker 0: 01:04:36</p><p>Yeah, I guess the one addition is that it&rsquo;s tied to that piece of information.
It&rsquo;s not an address generated by his wallet.
So he would have to make sure to keep that piece of extra information, because if he loses it, then he cannot get it back.
Yes.</p><p>Speaker 3: 01:04:53</p><p>But I also think that&rsquo;s a huge deal, because you already need to preserve a blob of information.
You know, the user doesn&rsquo;t even see the key anymore.
And the wallet software is holding on to that key for dear life because if it loses it, it can&rsquo;t sign anything anymore.
So this is just in an abstract sense, I think it&rsquo;s just a different blob of information the wallet needs to hold on to and make sure it backs up to the cloud or whatever.
It doesn&rsquo;t even matter if you keep it in iCloud or anything because it&rsquo;s not sensitive, it can&rsquo;t be abused by anyone, it can only send the funds to you.</p><p>Speaker 1: 01:05:26</p><p>One design challenge that I think will be for the recipient to, they have to be able to inspect this address, right?
Or what it does somehow.</p><p>Speaker 3: 01:05:42</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Speaker 1: 01:05:43</p><p>So that means I would kind of, wallet software would need to kind of surface this information in some kind of usable way.
Yeah.</p><p>Speaker 2: 01:06:00</p><p>I think about it like a bit like a joint, just like one set, cause like that also involves the PSPTs and all that stuff.
So maybe they could like construct.
So basically Charles could construct the transaction or like construct something, send it to Alice and then she does her stuff, adds her keys or signatures or like whatever.
And then she sends it back.
And that&rsquo;s like the transaction that&rsquo;s like ready to broadcast.
Is that the right way to think about it at all?</p><p>Speaker 3: 01:06:35</p><p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure.
What we can say is that when Bob receives the spending transaction that we haven&rsquo;t broadcast yet, he could even himself go and reconstruct the address.</p><div class=row></div></div></div></div><script src=https://btctranscripts.com/lib/jquery.min.js></script><script src=https://btctranscripts.com/lib/popper.min.js></script><script src=https://btctranscripts.com/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/lunr.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/auto-complete.js></script><link href=/plugins/auto-complete.css rel=stylesheet><script type=text/javascript>var baseurl="https://btctranscripts.com/"</script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/search.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://btctranscripts.com/js/custom.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/plugins/clipboard.js></script><script>new ClipboardJS(".btn")</script></body></html>
