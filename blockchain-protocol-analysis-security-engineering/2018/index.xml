Introductions Hi everyone. This presentation is based off of a paper called &amp;ldquo;Beyond Hellman&amp;rsquo;s time-memory trade-offs&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ll get to why it&amp;rsquo;s called that. These slides and the proofs are by Hamza Abusalah.
Outline I am going to describe what proofs of space are. I&amp;rsquo;ll give some previous constructions and information about them. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a simple new construction which has lots of advantages to it.</description></item><item><title>Schnorr Signatures For Bitcoin - Challenges and Opportunities</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/schnorr-signatures-for-bitcoin-challenges-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/schnorr-signatures-for-bitcoin-challenges-opportunities/</guid><description>Schnorr signatures for Bitcoin: Opportunities and challenges

Introduction My name is Pieter Wuille. I work at Blockstream. I contribute to Bitcoin Core and bitcoin research in general. I work on various proposals for the bitcoin system for some time now. Today I will be talking about Schnorr signatures for bitcoin, which is a project we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, on-and-off, for a couple of years now. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the cool things that we can do that might be non-obvious, and also some non-obvious challenges that we ran into while doing this.</description></item><item><title>Hardening Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/hardening-lightning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/hardening-lightning/</guid><description>Hardening lightning network

Introduction I am basically going to go over some ways that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about basically hardening lightning network, in terms of making security better and making the client more scalable itself, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about some issues and pain points that come up when you&amp;rsquo;re doing fees on mainnet. And there&amp;rsquo;s going to be some relatively minor changes that I propose to Bitcoin in this talk.</description></item><item><title>Simplicity</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-25-russell-oconnor-simplicity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-25-russell-oconnor-simplicity/</guid><description>Simplicity: A New Language for Blockchains

Intro Good morning everyone. I have been working on a new language for the consensus layer of blockchains and I am here to present that to you today.
Blockchains and Smart Contracts I know everyone is familiar with this in the audience but I want to make sure that I’m on the same page with you guys.</description></item><item><title>Smart Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-24-christopher-allen-smart-signatures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-24-christopher-allen-smart-signatures/</guid><description>Smart Signatures: Experiments in Authorization

Intro Good afternoon. My name is Christopher Allen, I am with Blockstream and today I wanted to give you an introduction to something that isn’t about consensus, isn’t about proof of stake and other things. I want to pop up a level. I want to talk about smart signatures. These are a number of experiments in authorization.
Digital Signatures First we need to recap, what is a digital signature?</description></item><item><title>Bulletproofs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/bulletproofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/bulletproofs/</guid><description>Bulletproofs

Introduction Good morning everyone. I am Benedikt Bünz and I am going to talk about bulletproofs. This is joint work with myself, Jonathan Bootle, Dan Boneh, Andrew Poelstra, Pieter Wuille, and Greg Maxwell. Bulletproofs are short proofs that we designed originally with the goal of improving confidential transactions but I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how they have many more applications and how they are short zero-knowledge proofs for arbitrary computations really.</description></item></channel></rss>
