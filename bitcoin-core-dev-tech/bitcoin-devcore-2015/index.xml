The instant transaction time.. you know I walk up to a cash register, I put my phone there, and in a second or two the transaction is confirmed and I walk away with my coffee. Anything beyond that, 10 minutes versus 1 minute doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. So the problem you want to solve is how do we get instant confirmation.. there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of ideas about this, like a trusted third party that promises to not double spend, have some coins locked up in a multisig wallet like Green Address.</description></item><item><title>James Gatto Marco Santori Bitcoin Law For Developers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/bitcoin-devcore-2015/james-gatto-marco-santori-bitcoin-law-for-developers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/bitcoin-devcore-2015/james-gatto-marco-santori-bitcoin-law-for-developers/</guid><description>Bitcoin law for developers

We are excited to be here and sponsoring this event. We have backgrounds in working on developer tools that goes back to the early days of something.
How do we mature the development of Bitcoin Core itself? One of the things that is useful is suss out the key components of it. In a standard you have a spec, it could be a whitepaper, and then you have a reference implementation, and then a test suite that enforces interoperability.</description></item><item><title>Research And Development Goals</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/bitcoin-devcore-2015/research-and-development-goals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/bitcoin-devcore-2015/research-and-development-goals/</guid><description>11:45 am: Open Discussion - R&amp;amp;D Goals &amp;amp; Challenges – Patrick Murck, Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields
We often see people saying they are testing the waters, they fixed a typo, they made a tiny little fix that doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact much, they are getting used to the process. They are finding that it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to contribut to Bitcoin Core. You code your changes, you submit your changes, there&amp;rsquo;s not much to it.</description></item></channel></rss>
