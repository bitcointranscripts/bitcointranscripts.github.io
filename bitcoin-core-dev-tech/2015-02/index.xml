I want to introduce you to James Gatto and Marco Santori with Pilsbury. They will be spending some time talking about Bitcoin law. They have a room this afternoon and they are offering to talk with you one on one. So Marco and James.
You missed the introduction. Was it any good? (laughter)
We are here to talk about legal issues.</description></item><item><title>Gavinandresen</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/gavinandresen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/gavinandresen/</guid><description>http://blog.circle.com/2015/02/10/devcore-livestream/
The instant transaction time.. you know I walk up to a cash register, I put my phone there, and in a second or two the transaction is confirmed and I walk away with my coffee. Anything beyond that, 10 minutes versus 1 minute doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. So the problem you want to solve is how do we get instant confirmation.. there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of ideas about this, like a trusted third party that promises to not double spend, have some coins locked up in a multisig wallet like Green Address.</description></item><item><title>R&amp;D Goals &amp; Challenges</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/research-and-development-goals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/research-and-development-goals/</guid><description>We often see people saying they are testing the waters, they fixed a typo, they made a tiny little fix that doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact much, they are getting used to the process. They are finding that it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to contribut to Bitcoin Core. You code your changes, you submit your changes, there&amp;rsquo;s not much to it.
There&amp;rsquo;s a difference, and the lines are fuzzy and undefined, and you can make a change to Core that changes a spelling error or a change to policy or consensus rules, for those high-level things, for ecosystem-level things, there&amp;rsquo;s several mailing lists, the dev list gets the most traffic.</description></item><item><title>Talk by the founders of Circle</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/jeremy-allaire-circle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/jeremy-allaire-circle/</guid><description>We are excited to be here and sponsoring this event. We have backgrounds in working on developer tools that goes back to the early days of something.
How do we mature the development of Bitcoin Core itself? One of the things that is useful is suss out the key components of it. In a standard you have a spec, it could be a whitepaper, and then you have a reference implementation, and then a test suite that enforces interoperability.</description></item></channel></rss>
