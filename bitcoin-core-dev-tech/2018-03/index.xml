Priorities We&amp;rsquo;re going to wait until BlueMatt is here. Nobody knows what his priorities are. He says he might be in around noon.
There&amp;rsquo;s an ex-Google product director interested in helping with Bitcoin Core. He was asking about how to get involved. I told him to get involved by just diving in. He will be spending some time at Chaincode at the end of March. We&amp;rsquo;ll get a sense for what his skills are.</description></item><item><title>Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees - MAST</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-06-merkleized-abstract-syntax-trees-mast/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-06-merkleized-abstract-syntax-trees-mast/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/972120890279432192

MAST stuff You could directly merkleize scripts if you switch from IF, IFNOT, ELSE with IFJUMP that has the number of bytes.
With graftroot and taproot, you never to do any scripts (which were a hack to get things started). But we&amp;rsquo;re doing validation and computation.
You take every single path it has; so instead, it becomes &amp;hellip; certain condition, or certain not conditions&amp;hellip; You take every possible ifs, you use this, you say it&amp;rsquo;s one of these, then you specify which one, and you show it and everyone else can validate this.</description></item><item><title>Taproot, Graftroot, Etc</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-06-taproot-graftroot-etc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-06-taproot-graftroot-etc/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/972468121046061056
graftroot The idea of graftroot is that in every contract there is a superset of people that can spend the money. This assumption is not always true but it&amp;rsquo;s almost always true. Say you want to lock up these coins for a year, without any conditionals to it, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. But assume you have&amp;ndash; pubkey recovery? No&amp;hellip; pubkey recovery is inherently incompatible with any form of aggregation, and aggregation is far superior.</description></item><item><title>Bellare Neven</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-05-bellare-neven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-05-bellare-neven/</guid><description>See also http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation/
Bellare-Neven It&amp;rsquo;s been published, it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a decade, and it&amp;rsquo;s widely cited. In Bellare-Neven, it&amp;rsquo;s itself, it&amp;rsquo;s a multi-signature scheme which means multiple pubkeys and one message. You should treat the individual authorizations to spend inputs, as individual messages. What we need is an interactive aggregate signature scheme. Bellare-Neven&amp;rsquo;s paper suggests a trivial way of building an aggregate signature scheme out of a multisig scheme where interactively everyone signs everyone&amp;rsquo;s message.</description></item><item><title>Cross Curve Atomic Swaps</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-05-cross-curve-atomic-swaps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03/2018-03-05-cross-curve-atomic-swaps/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/971827042223345664
Draft of an upcoming scriptless scripts paper. This was at the beginning of 2017. But now an entire year has gone by.

An adaptor signature.. if you have different generators, then the two secrets to reveal, you just give someone both of them, plus a proof of a discrete log, and then you say learn the secret to one that gets the reveal to be the same.</description></item></channel></rss>
