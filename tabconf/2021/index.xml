Intro I am here to talk about Miniscript. This is something that I have talked about a few times before but usually in a much more technical way where we get into the weeds of Bitcoin Script and what Miniscript is and how to use it and stuff. I want to talk today about Miniscript from the perspective of someone actually trying to use Bitcoin and how this solves problems that I think are very important in the space regarding how to custody your coins, how to keep track of your keys, stuff like that.</description></item><item><title>Covenants</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/</guid><description>Topic: Covenants

I now spend my time, full time at Square Crypto working on a project we call the Lightning Dev Kit (LDK). So, working to enable Lightning to be more accessible to developers and I&amp;rsquo;m here to talk about that and give the lay of the land for why it exists, what the state of the Lightning ecosystem is broadly, and why we think it&amp;rsquo;s an important project and why Square is funding us, to work on it.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Mining Firmware and Stratum v2 - Rachel Rybarczyk - TABConf 2021</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/bitcoin-mining-firmware-and-stratum-v2-rachel-rybarczyk-tabconf-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/bitcoin-mining-firmware-and-stratum-v2-rachel-rybarczyk-tabconf-2021/</guid><description>Introduction Coming to the stage next, she is the VP of Mining at Galaxy Digital.
