I work at Spiral. And most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on adding support for taproot channels. At least I try to work on that, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting pulled back into Swift bindings. And this presentation is supposed to be about why the taproot spec is laid out the way it is. What are some of the motivations, the constraints, limitations that are driving the design. And I wanna really dig deep into the math that some of the vulnerabilities that we&amp;rsquo;re trying to avoid as well as how we&amp;rsquo;re solving those issues.</description></item><item><title>Anchors &amp; Shackles (Ark)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/anchors-shackles-ark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/anchors-shackles-ark/</guid><description>So hey guys, my name is Borat. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the past, let&amp;rsquo;s say, six months or so. To give a bit of a background, I started first in a big block sort of camp and then got introduced later to Liquid. And I did some covenant R&amp;amp;D on Liquid for about two years, and now I&amp;rsquo;m recently exploring the Lightning space for about a year.</description></item><item><title>Building Trustless Bridges</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/building-trustless-bridges/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/building-trustless-bridges/</guid><description>Many mechanisms have been created that enable users to lock BTC on the mainchain, transfer a claim on the BTC in some offchain system, and then later redeem the claim and take ownership of the underlying BTC. Colloquially known as &amp;ldquo;bridges&amp;rdquo;, these mechanisms offer a diverse range of security and usability properties for users to choose from depending on their risk tolerance and cost preferences. This talk will give an overview of the different types of BTC bridges that exist, how they work, and how they can be improved.</description></item><item><title>Exploring P2P Hashrate Markets V2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/exploring-p2p-hashrate-markets-v2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/exploring-p2p-hashrate-markets-v2/</guid><description>Using multisig to protect hashrate delivery so everyone can mine bitcoin again while figuring out how to pay out coinbase sats over lightning.</description></item><item><title>Translational Bitcoin Development</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/translational-bitcoin-development/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinplusplus/layer-2/translational-bitcoin-development/</guid><description>Introduction This is called Translational Bitcoin Development or Why Johnny Can&amp;rsquo;t Verify. So quick intro, I&amp;rsquo;m Tadge Dryja. Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on in Bitcoin over the last decade is the Bitcoin Lightning Network paper, the Discreet Log Contracts paper, Utreexo, and building out a lot of that software. In terms of places I&amp;rsquo;ve worked, Lightning Labs, founded that, and then MIT DCI is where I used to work for a couple years and now I&amp;rsquo;m at a company called Lightspark.</description></item></channel></rss>
