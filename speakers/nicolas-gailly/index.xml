This is work with my colleagues in addition to myself.
Why aggregate? Distributed systems often require gathering statements about large subsets of nodes. However, processing (filtering, aggregating&amp;hellip;) measurements can be a bottleneck. We want to apply some processing while collecting the measurements.
Why byzantine? A byzantine node is a node that can be arbitrary. It can be offline and it can be anything it wants and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to respect the protocol specification.</description></item></channel></rss>
