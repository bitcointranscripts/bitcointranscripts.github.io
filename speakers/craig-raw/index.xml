Stephan – 00:02:53 Craig, welcome back to the show.
Craig :
Great, Stephan, it’s really good to be back.
Stephan :
Yeah, there’s been so many updates going on with Sparrow Wallet and I thought it’d be great to have you back to chat about the space. Whether it’s multisignature or privacy or import and export of transactions, I think there’s lots of things to add. So, yeah, I’m just curious, as you look at the space now, what are some of the big things on your mind, just kind of more broadly?</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Multi Sig With Sparrow Wallet</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-03-24-craig-raw-bitcoin-multi-sig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-03-24-craig-raw-bitcoin-multi-sig/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/262/
Stephan Livera:
Craig welcome to the show.
Craig Raw:
Hi there, Stephan! It’s great to be here.
Stephan Livera:
So Craig I’ve been seeing what you’re doing with Sparrow wallet and I thought it’s time to get this guy on the show. So can you, I mean, obviously I know you’re under a pseudonym, right? So don’t dox anything about yourself that you don’t want that you’re not comfortable to, but can you tell us a little bit about how you got into Bitcoin and why you’re interested in Bitcoin?</description></item><item><title>Making Bitcoin More Private with CISA</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-2024/making-bitcoin-more-private-with-cisa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-2024/making-bitcoin-more-private-with-cisa/</guid><description>Delve into the world of Cross-Input Signature Aggregation (CISA) with our expert panel from Sparrow Wallet, Bitcoin Core, and Casa.
