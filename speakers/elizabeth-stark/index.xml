Introduction WP: We have a fireside chat with Stacy Herbert from Kaiser Report and Elizabeth Stark. Some people say she is the CEO of Lightning Network, but she is the CEO of Lightning Labs. Let&amp;rsquo;s invite them on stage.
SH: Did anyone notice the bitcoin price today? How many here are reckless? How many of you have used lightning? Alright, how many are torchbearers?</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin- Native Currency of the Internet</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-02-11-jack-dorsey-elizabeth-stark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-02-11-jack-dorsey-elizabeth-stark/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/52/
Stephan Livera: Welcome to the Stephan Livera podcast, focused on Bitcoin and Austrian economics. Learn the technology and economics of Bitcoin by listening in to interviews with the best and brightest. It’s a very special episode today with Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, and also Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs.
Stephan Livera: I’ve been very impressed with Jack’s commentary on Bitcoin as potentially the native currency of the internet, and the way he’s been managing Square and one of Square’s products in particular, the Cash App, which allows for Bitcoin purchases and sales.</description></item><item><title>Interview Adam Back Elizabeth Stark</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/interview-adam-back-elizabeth-stark/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/interview-adam-back-elizabeth-stark/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1005842855271784449
