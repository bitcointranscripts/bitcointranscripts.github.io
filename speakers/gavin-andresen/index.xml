He&amp;rsquo;s going to talk about chain sizes and all that.
Cool, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to follow you guys. Thank you, it&amp;rsquo;s great to be here. I was here last time and had a great time. I&amp;rsquo;m really happy that it&amp;rsquo;s not snowing because we&amp;rsquo;ve had too much snow. I&amp;rsquo;m also happy that you all decided to listen to me on a Sunday morning. I don&amp;rsquo;t usually give talks on Sunday.</description></item><item><title>R&amp;D Goals &amp; Challenges</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/research-and-development-goals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2015-02/research-and-development-goals/</guid><description>We often see people saying they are testing the waters, they fixed a typo, they made a tiny little fix that doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact much, they are getting used to the process.

There&amp;rsquo;s a difference, and the lines are fuzzy and undefined, and you can make a change to Core that changes a spelling error or a change to policy or consensus rules, for those high-level things, for ecosystem-level things, there&amp;rsquo;s several mailing lists, the dev list gets the most traffic.</description></item><item><title>Reaching Consensus on Open Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/reaching-consensus-open-blockchains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/reaching-consensus-open-blockchains/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:
