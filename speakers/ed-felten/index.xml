Introduction Thank you, good morning everybody. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about our latest version of our Abitrum system. The first version was discussed in a paper in 2018. Since then, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of advances in my technology and a real running system has been made. This is the first working roll-up system for general smart contracts.
First I will set the scene to provide some context on what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about and how what we&amp;rsquo;re doing fits into the larger picture.</description></item></channel></rss>
