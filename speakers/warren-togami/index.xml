Introduction Hello. My name is Warren Togami and I will be talking about exchange security. Not only protecting the people but also the business. This has been a topic of interest recently.
Warren&amp;rsquo;s security background I have some credibility when it comes to security due to my previous career in open-source software. I have been working on the Linux operating system first with Fedora then with Red Hat for many years.</description></item><item><title>Five Insights into the Defense of Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/defense-of-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/defense-of-bitcoin/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137389045355614208
Introduction Today I work at Blockstream but I have a long long history working in open-source software first with the Linux operating system as an advocate then working on the operating system itself. This has led me to a few insights on the defense of bitcoin that has little to do with software but it needs a talk thrown together very quickly for today.
Defense by safety-critical engineering process I believe that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to have a truly decentralized development process.</description></item></channel></rss>
