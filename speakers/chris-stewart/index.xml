Chris, welcome to the show.
Chris Stewart:
Hey, nice to be talking with you, Stephan.
Stephan Livera:
Chris, I’m a fan of your work. I like reading your posts and hearing some of your commentary in the space. I know you’re doing a lot of stuff: obviously you’re CEO and founder of Suredbits. Can you tell us a little bit about what’s on your mind lately in terms of what’s happening in the space?</description></item><item><title>Private Key Management</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-19-chris-stewart-private-key-management/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-19-chris-stewart-private-key-management/</guid><description>Lightning 101 for Exchanges: Private Key Management

Intro Hi everybody. My name is Chris Stewart. I’m the Founder of a company called Suredbits. We monetize APIs with Lightning but we strongly believe that the quickest way to widespread Lightning adoption is through exchanges. As other people have said at this conference most cryptocurrency economic activity does happen through exchanges right now.</description></item></channel></rss>
