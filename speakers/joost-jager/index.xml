I work for Lightning Labs. At Lightning Labs, I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, and my main focus is on LND. Over the last month, I spent quite some time to improve pathfinding in LND. In this talk, I would like to explain how we optimize pathfinding for the reliability of paths.
Lightning payment pathfinding So we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a path. That&amp;rsquo;s clear. But what do we optimize the path for?</description></item><item><title>HODL Invoices</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-09-joost-jager-hodl-invoices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-09-joost-jager-hodl-invoices/</guid><description>Hodl Invoices (Breaking Bitcoin training session)

Intro My name is Joost, Michael introduced me already. I’ve been working with Lightning Labs since the middle of last year and during that time I’ve worked on several subprojects within lnd. lnd is the Lightning implementation developed by Lightning Labs. I’m not sure really what the background knowledge is at this point in this three day course. One of those subprojects within lnd is called hodl invoices and this is the topic that I would like to talk about today.</description></item><item><title>Security Aspects of Lightning Network Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-routing-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-routing-security/</guid><description>D146 D0F6 8939 4362 68FA 9A13 0E26 BB61 B76C 4D3A

Introduction Together with my colleagues I am building lnd. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the implementations of lightning. In routing, there&amp;rsquo;s the sender of the payment, the intermediate routing nodes that forward payments, and a receiver. I would like to scope this down to looking at security just from the perspective of the sender.
Goals of LN Why are we doing all of this?</description></item></channel></rss>
