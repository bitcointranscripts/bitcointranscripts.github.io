Introduction My talk today is about what I&amp;rsquo;m calling CoinjoinXT which is kind of a new proposal. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s a new technology, but perhaps a new combination of technologies. My name is Adam Gibson. Yes, another Adam, sorry about that. I have been working on privacy tech for the last number of years, mostly on joinmarket.</description></item><item><title>Unfairly Linear Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-06-12-adam-gibson-unfairly-linear-signatures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-06-12-adam-gibson-unfairly-linear-signatures/</guid><description>Location: London Bitcoin Devs

Intro This is supposed to be a developer meetup but this talk is going to be a little more on the theoretical side. The title is “Unfairly Linear Signatures” that is just a joke. It is talking about Schnorr signatures. They are something that could in the near future have a big practical significance in Bitcoin. I am not going to explain all the practical significance.</description></item></channel></rss>
