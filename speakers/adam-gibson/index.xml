Introduction My name&amp;rsquo;s Adam Gibson, also known as waxwing on the internet. Though the title might suggest that I have the solution to the problem of implementing CoinJoin, it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly true. It&amp;rsquo;s a clickbait. I haven&amp;rsquo;t, but I suppose what I can say in a more serious way is that I&amp;rsquo;m proposing what I consider to be a meaningfully different alternative way of looking at the concept of CoinJoin and therefore at the concept of on-chain privacy because the conversation nowadays about on-chain privacy tends to be dominated by CoinJoin.</description></item><item><title>How to Design Schnorr Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/how-to-design-schnorr-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/how-to-design-schnorr-signatures/</guid><description>Passwords So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk to you today about passwords and about the problem with passwords and how we might be able to solve it, right? So we&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with using passwords on the internet and we&amp;rsquo;re all sort of sometimes annoyed about it. Maybe you use a password manager, maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t, but you have this problem, I think we all understand this problem that it&amp;rsquo;s not just about you losing the password, but it&amp;rsquo;s also about keeping it secret, right?</description></item><item><title>What is Lightning Network?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/what-is-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoinology/what-is-lightning-network/</guid><description>Introduction Hello everyone. We&amp;rsquo;re going to sort of soft start now, and this is a new meetup group we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to call Bitcoinology. It&amp;rsquo;s a whimsical name. It&amp;rsquo;s really intended to convey the idea that we want to discuss Bitcoin not in a super developer technical code way, but we do want to discuss it—how it&amp;rsquo;s used, even what the history and culture of it are, and what are the interesting things as a user and as a sort of Bitcoin person you can learn.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar - Coinswap</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-06-23-socratic-seminar-coinswap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-06-23-socratic-seminar-coinswap/</guid><description>Pastebin of the resources discussed: https://pastebin.com/zbegGmb8

Introductions Michael Folkson (MF): This is London BitDevs, this is a Socratic Seminar. We had two events last week so it is great to see so many people on the call.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar - BBIP Schnorr (BIP 340)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-06-16-socratic-seminar-bip-schnorr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-06-16-socratic-seminar-bip-schnorr/</guid><description>Pastebin of the resources discussed: https://pastebin.com/uyktht33

Intro (Michael Folkson) We are live, London BitDevs Socratic Seminar on Bitcoin privacy with Adam Gibson. This is a live call on Jitsi. We are streaming on YouTube so bear that in mind.

Stephan Livera:
Adam, welcome to the show.
Waxwing (Adam Gibson):
Hello, Stephan,
Stephan Livera:
Thank you for joining me. I’ve been very keen to have you on the show. I guess some listeners will know you as Waxwing you’re probably more known as Waxwing than as Adam.
Waxwing (Adam Gibson):
Little bit more. Yeah, yeah.
Stephan Livera:
But yeah, I’m a big fan of your work. I really like what you’ve done in terms of putting a lot of educational stuff like your blog and your work with JoinMarket and obviously you’ve got a, a history within the space and a focus on, I would say, you know, Bitcoin privacy and also around the cryptography and the mathematics behind it.</description></item><item><title>SNICKER</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/snicker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/snicker/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s episode Adam Gibson discusses various aspects of the SNICKER protocol. He introduces the concept of non-interactive coinjoin and how SNICKER aims to address the privacy and coordination issues of current coinjoin systems. He explains the process of constructing a transaction in the SNICKER protocol, including the use of shared secrets, diffie-hellman key exchange, and the role of participants in signing and validating the transaction. He also explores the potential improvements and future developments of SNICKER, such as competitive proposals and encryption methods. Overall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the SNICKER protocol and its potential applications in improving the privacy and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.
Later on the discussions revolve around the efficiency and privacy of retrieving proposals from a receiver, the potential usefulness of SNICKER outside of mobile devices, the implementation of SNICKER as a proof-of-concept, analyzing different blockchain transactions, and expressing gratitude for the insightful presentation and interest in future sessions. There is also a focus on investigating different protocols like CashShuffle and CoinShuffle, as well as the possibility of implementing CoinJoin. The participants express their interest in exploring these topics further in future discussions.</description></item><item><title>CoinjoinXT and other techniques for deniable transfers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/coinjoinxt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/coinjoinxt/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1014197088979226625

Introduction My talk today is about what I&amp;rsquo;m calling CoinjoinXT which is kind of a new proposal. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s a new technology, but perhaps a new combination of technologies. My name is Adam Gibson. Yes, another Adam, sorry about that. I have been working on privacy tech for the last number of years, mostly on joinmarket. Today&amp;rsquo;s talk is not about joinmarket, but it is about coinjoin.</description></item><item><title>Unfairly Linear Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-06-12-adam-gibson-unfairly-linear-signatures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-06-12-adam-gibson-unfairly-linear-signatures/</guid><description>Slides: https://joinmarket.me/static/schnorrplus.pdf
Intro This is supposed to be a developer meetup but this talk is going to be a little more on the theoretical side. The title is “Unfairly Linear Signatures” that is just a joke. It is talking about Schnorr signatures. They are something that could in the near future have a big practical significance in Bitcoin. I am not going to explain all the practical significance.
Outline To give you an outline, I will explain what all these terms mean and how they fit in shortly.</description></item></channel></rss>
