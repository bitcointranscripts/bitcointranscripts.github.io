Stephan Livera:
John, welcome back to the show.
John Cantrell:
Hey, how’s it going? Happy to be back.
Stephan Livera:
So John, a lot has happened since the last time you were on the show. You are now working with Sensei and you’ve got this new Lightning node and interface that you’ve got to present and talk about. Do you want to just maybe tell us a little bit about the journey for yourself in terms of how you got to where you are now since the last time we spoke, since you were cracking Alistair Milne’s 12-word seed.</description></item><item><title>Bruteforcing Bitcoin Seeds</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-06-30-john-cantrell-bruteforcing-bitcoin-seeds/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-06-30-john-cantrell-bruteforcing-bitcoin-seeds/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/187/

I’m going to bring in my guest, John is a developer and he’s also known for working on the juggernaut project and he’s got this fantastic article that he wrote recently that I wanted to get him on and discuss. So John, welcome to the show.
John Cantrell:
It’s great to be here.
Stephan Livera:
So John, tell us a little bit about yourself and your background as a developer.</description></item></channel></rss>
