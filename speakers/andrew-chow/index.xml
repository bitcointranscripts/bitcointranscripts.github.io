What am I working on? I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on essentially rewriting the Bitcoin Core wallet, one piece at a time. Now when I say &amp;ldquo;the wallet&amp;rdquo;, a lot of people think of the GUI. That&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Rather I&amp;rsquo;ve been changing the internals; how keys are managed, how transactions are tracked, how inputs are selected for spending.</description></item><item><title>Descriptor Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-andrew-chow-descriptor-wallets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-andrew-chow-descriptor-wallets/</guid><description>Topic: Rethinking Wallet Architecture: Native Descriptor Wallets

Intro Hi everyone. I am Andrew Chow, I am an engineer at Blockstream and also a Bitcoin Core contributor working mostly on the Bitcoin Core wallet. Today I am going to be talking about rethinking the wallet architecture with native descriptor wallets.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>Hardware Wallets in Bitcoin Core

Introduction Hey everyone. As you may have guessed I’m Andrew Chow. I’m Engineer at Blockstream and I also work on Bitcoin Core a lot, mostly in the wallet. I am going to be talking about hardware wallets and a bit history with them in Core and also how to integrate them in Core and how we are integrating them into Core.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-07-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-07-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1136924010955104257
How much should Bitcoin Core do, and how much should other libraries do? Andrew Chow wrote the wonderful HWI tool. Right now we have a pull request to support external signers. The HWI script can talk to most major hardware wallets because it has all the drivers built in now, and it can get keys from it, and sign arbitrary transactions. That&amp;rsquo;s roughly what it does. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of manual, though.</description></item><item><title>Wallet Architecture</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-05-wallet-architecture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-05-wallet-architecture/</guid><description>Bitcoin Core wallet architecture + descriptors

Wallet architecture discussion There are three main areas here. One is IsMine: how do I determine a particular output is affecting my wallet? What about asking for a new address, where is it coming from? That&amp;rsquo;s not just get new address, it&amp;rsquo;s get raw change address, it&amp;rsquo;s also change being created in fundrawtransaction. The third issue is wallet signing. Storage is not an entrypoint, it&amp;rsquo;s just a way of implementing these things.</description></item><item><title>Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-03-15-partially-signed-bitcoin-transactions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-03-15-partially-signed-bitcoin-transactions/</guid><description>Topic: PSBT
Location: SF Bitcoin Devs
Introduction Andrew: So as Mark said I&amp;rsquo;m Andrew Chow and today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about BIP 174, partially signed Bitcoin transactions, also known as PSBT. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking a bit about why we need PSBTs, or Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions, what they are, and the actual format of the transaction itself and how to use a PSBT and the workflows around that.</description></item></channel></rss>
