Introduction I am going to show you proof of necessary work today. We use proof of work in a prototype. This is joint work with my collaborators.
Problems We wanted to tackle the problem of bitcoin blockchain size increases. Every 10 minutes, a block is added to the blockchain and the blockchain grows linearly in size over time. Initial block download increases over time.</description></item><item><title>Proof Of Necessary Work</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-necessary-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-necessary-work/</guid><description>Proof of Necessary Work: Succinct State Verification with Fairness Guarantees

Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s start with something familiar. When you have a new lite client, or any client that wants to trustlessly connect to the network and joins the network for the first time&amp;hellip; they see this: they need to download a lot of data, initially, and then on an ongoing basis. They need to do a lot of verification and computation on top of this data.</description></item></channel></rss>
