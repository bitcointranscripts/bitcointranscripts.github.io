Antoine and Salvatori, welcome to the show.
Antoine :
Thanks for having us.
Salvatore :
Thank you, Stephan.
Stephan :
So I know you guys are both building out some stuff in Miniscript. Obviously, software and hardware. And I know this is an interesting area, there’s been a bit of discussion about it, but there’s also been some critique about it as well. So I’d be interested to get into this with you guys, but maybe first if we could start.</description></item><item><title>Ledger’s New Bitcoin App- PSBT, Taproot, Descriptors, Multi-Sig</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2022-01-11-salvatore-ingala/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2022-01-11-salvatore-ingala/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/337/
Stephan Livera:
Salvatore, welcome to the show.
Salvatore Ingala:
Thank you, Stephan. I learned a lot from your past shows, so I hope I can bring contributions as well.
Stephan Livera:
Fantastic. Well, Salvatore, for people who don’t know you, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you’re doing and where you’re working?
Salvatore Ingala:
Yeah. So I have a background from academia. I did a PhD in algorithms before switching my attention to cryptocurrencies.</description></item></channel></rss>
