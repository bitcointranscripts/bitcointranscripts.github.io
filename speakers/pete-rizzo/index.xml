Stephan Livera:
Pete, welcome to the show.
Pete Rizzo:
Hey. Well, thanks for having me glad to be here and excited to chat.
Stephan Livera:

But also just for listeners who don’t know you, can you just take a minute and just tell them a bit about yourself and your involvement in the Bitcoin world?</description></item></channel></rss>
