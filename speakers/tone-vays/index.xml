Bitcoin Association Guy (BAG)
BAG: I&amp;rsquo;m here with Bruce Fenton and Tone Vays. Bruce is also host of the Satoshi Roundtable and a long-term investor. Tone Vays is a derivatives trader and content creator. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about Wall Street. I believe you&amp;rsquo;re both based in NY? How was the last 12 months?
TV: I own an apartment there, but I think I spent 9 months a year everywhere else.</description></item><item><title>Trading Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/trading-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/trading-panel/</guid><description>MM: As Trace Mayer says, it&amp;rsquo;s chasing the rabbit.

TV: My name is Tone Vays. I come from the traditional Wall Street trading environment. I joined the crypto space in 2013. I spoke at my first conference and wrote my first article in Q1 2014. I was doing some trading. With the popularity of the youtube channel and going to conferences, I went back to trading options in traditional markets.</description></item></channel></rss>
