History This should be easy to follow. I want to start off with some history. The first mention of atomic swap concepts was in 2013 in a bitcointalk.org thread where people were wondering how to exchange coins between independent ledgers in a trustless way. There were a few comments on the thread every now and then asking has anyone implemented this. It was quiet until last year when people started doing atomic swaps last year.</description></item><item><title>Work In Progress Sessions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/work-in-progress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/work-in-progress/</guid><description>((this needs to break into individual transcripts))

Optical proof of work Mikael Dubrovsky
I am working on optical proof-of-work. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to pack a lot into the 10 minutes. I spent a year and a half at Techion.
