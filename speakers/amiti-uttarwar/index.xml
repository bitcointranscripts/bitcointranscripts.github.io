They delve into the challenges and objectives of address relay, highlighting its complexities and the importance of propagating IP addresses to maintain network connectivity and prevent partitioning and eclipse attacks. The discussion covers the design and evolution of AddrMan, introduced in 2012 to manage IP addresses, and the impact of changes like rate-limiting address gossip to mitigate spam. Pieter and Amiti also touch on the significance of maintaining separate network stacks for different network protocols and the potential of employing ASMAP to improve network resilience. The conversation underscores ongoing efforts and future directions for enhancing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s P2P network.</description></item><item><title>The P2P network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/the-p2p-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/the-p2p-network/</guid><description>In this episode of the Chaincode Podcast, Amiti Uttarwar discusses the intricacies of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in Bitcoin with hosts Adam Jonas and Mark Erhardt. Amiti explains her fascination with P2P due to its logical yet complex interactions across the global network of nodes. She outlines five key principles for designing effective P2P networks: reliability, timeliness, accessibility, privacy, and upgradeability. The conversation delves into specific challenges, such as Eclipse attacks, address relay, and the role of the address manager (AddrMan) in maintaining network integrity. Amiti also highlights the delicate balance between ensuring privacy and achieving network reliability. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of continuous collaboration and innovation in Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s P2P network development.</description></item><item><title>Attacking Bitcoin Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/la-bitdevs/2020-04-16-amiti-uttarwar-attacking-bitcoin-core/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/la-bitdevs/2020-04-16-amiti-uttarwar-attacking-bitcoin-core/</guid><description>Intro I’m going to talk to you today about attacking Bitcoin Core.
Bitcoin To start with the fundamentals. As we all know Bitcoin is a money and it is different to our existing centralized solution of money because instead we have nodes that are running all around the world.
Consensus Fundamentally what is required for this to work is the idea of consensus where all the nodes must agree on the same fundamental values.</description></item><item><title>Rebroadcast logic in Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/rebroadcasting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/rebroadcasting/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171042478088232960
Introduction Hi, my name is Amiti. Thank you for having me here today. I wanted to talk with you about rebroadcasting logic in Bitcoin Core. For some context, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving it this summer. I wanted to tell you all about it.
What is rebroadcasting? We all know what a broadcast is. It&amp;rsquo;s hwen we send an INV message out to our peers and we let them know about a new transaction.</description></item><item><title>Transaction Rebroadcast</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-09-09-amiti-uttarwar-transaction-rebroadcast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-09-09-amiti-uttarwar-transaction-rebroadcast/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1199710296199385088

Introduction Hello. Thank you for joining me today. My name is Amiti and I’d like to tell you a bit about my Bitcoin journey.
Professional Background I graduated from Carnegie Mellon five years ago and ever since I’ve worked at a few different startups in San Francisco Bay Area. My adventures with blockchains began when I worked at Simbi. Simbi is a marketplace for trading and bartering services. Here I found a community of people who were living outside of their means.</description></item></channel></rss>
