This problem, stemming from an &amp;ldquo;OG Satoshi bug,&amp;rdquo; has been partially addressed over time through various Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), specifically BIP30 and BIP34, which aimed to prevent duplicate transactions by ensuring unique coinbase transactions in each block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, a subsequent realization highlighted a loophole: early blocks (pre-BIP34) could contain numerical sequences in their coinbase transactions that might accidentally be replicated in future blocks, posing a potential risk of creating duplicate transactions again. This issue, dubbed the &amp;ldquo;Block 1,983,702 Problem,&amp;rdquo; could theoretically allow an attacker to exploit this loophole, though it would require significant resources and specific conditions to be feasible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To mitigate this risk, a temporary fix was implemented in 2018, deciding to reinstate BIP30 checks from block 1,983,702 onwards, giving the Bitcoin community time to find a more permanent solution. Several potential fixes are discussed, including making SegWit mandatory for all blocks, which would inherently prevent the duplication issue by ensuring a unique identifier in each block that was not present in pre-BIP34 blocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout the conversation, Provoost and van Wirdum explore the technical nuances of the problem, the historical context of its discovery, and the implications for Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s security and consensus mechanism. They emphasize the importance of proactive problem-solving in the Bitcoin community while acknowledging the complexities involved in implementing changes to the protocol.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ocean Tides</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/ocean-tides/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/ocean-tides/</guid><description>In this episode of Bitcoin, Explained, Aaron and Sjors explain what features are offered by Ocean, the relaunched and rebranded Eligius mining pool.

&lt;p>Silent Payments resemble earlier ideas like Stealth Addresses and Reusable Payment Codes, in that they allow users to publish a static “address”, while this is not the actual Bitcoin address they will be paid on. Instead, senders of a transaction can use this static address to generate new Bitcoin addresses for the recipient, for which the recipient — and only the recipient — can in turn generate the corresponding private keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like Stealth Addresses and Reusable Payment Codes, the benefit of Silent Payments is that addresses can be posted publicly without harming users’ privacy; snoops cannot link the publicly posted address to the actual Bitcoin addresses that the recipient is paid on. Meanwhile, unlike Stealth Addresses and Reusable Payment Codes, Silent Payments do not require any additional blockchain data— though this does come at a computational cost for the recipient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The podcast episode details all this in roughly two parts. In the first half of the episode, Ruben, Aaron and Sjors break down how Silent Payments work, and in the second half of the episode they discuss how Silent Payments compare to Stealth Addresses and Reusable Payment Codes, as well as some potential implementation issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>User Rejected Soft Forks (URSFs)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/are-users-rejecting-bitcoin-forks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/are-users-rejecting-bitcoin-forks/</guid><description>Intro Aaron: Live from Utrecht, this is Bitcoin, Explained.

&lt;p>Taproot, the last soft fork to have been deployed on the Bitcoin network, activated in late 2021. Now, Bitcoin Core developers are considering to &amp;lsquo;bury&amp;rsquo; the soft fork, which means that future Bitcoin Core releases will treat Taproot as if the rule change has been active since Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s very beginning. (With the exception of one block mined in 2021 that breached the Taproot rules which have since been added to the protocol.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the episode, Sjors explains what the benefits are of burying a soft fork, in particular pointing out how it helps developers when they review the Bitcoin Core codebase or when they perform tests on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, Aaron and Sjors outline a potential edge case scenario where burying soft forks could, in a worst-case scenario, split the Bitcoin blockchain between upgraded and non-upgraded nodes. Bitcoin Core developers generally don&amp;rsquo;t consider this edge case - a very long block re-org - to be a realistic problem and/or believe that this would be such a big problem that a buried soft fork would be a minor concern comparatively. However, they explain, not everyone agrees with this assessment entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Aaron and Sjors touch on issues like whether soft fork activation logic should itself be considered a soft fork, and whether soft fork burying logic should be considered a consensus change and/or require a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mempool (And Why We Need It)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/death-to-the-mempool-long-live-the-mempool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/death-to-the-mempool-long-live-the-mempool/</guid><description>Preamble Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:20

&lt;p>Where coins on Bitcoin’s base layer are sent to addresses, the Lightning network uses invoices. Invoices communicate the requested amount, node destination, and the hash of a secret which is used for payment routing. This works, but has a number of limitations, Sjors explains, notably that the amount must be bitcoin-denominated (as opposed for fiat denominated), and the invoice can only be used once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BOLT 12, which has been implemented in c-ligtning, is a way to essentially refer a payer to the node that is to be paid, in order to request a new invoice. While the BOLT 12 offer can be static and reusable — it always refers to the same node — the payee can generate new invoices on the fly when requested, allowing for much more flexibility, Sjors explains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Aaron and Sjors discuss how the new BOLT 12 messages are communicated over the Lightning Network through an update to the BOLT 7 specification for message relay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replace-by-Fee Bug (CVE-2021-31876)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/replace-by-fee-bug/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/replace-by-fee-bug/</guid><description>Intro Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:08

&lt;p>They explained that Speedy Trial would give miners three months to signal support for the Taproot upgrade with their hash power. If a supermajority of miners signals support for the upgrade within these three months, Taproot will activate a couple of months later: six months since the release of the software client that includes the activation logic. If miners don&amp;rsquo;t signal support within three months, the upgrade will expire and a new upgrade path can be considered. (It is, as of yet, not defined what the potential alternative upgrade path would look like).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Van Wirdum explained that Speedy Trial was born out of a compromise between developers and users who preferred different upgrade mechanisms for the Taproot soft fork, while Provoost detailed what some of the more technical implementation considerations of Speedy Trial are, like the benefits of using block heights instead of timestamps, and the extended delay between signaling and enforcement. Finally, the hosts discussed some of the downsides and risks of Speedy Trial.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallet Integration in Bitcoin Core and HWI</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/hardware-wallet-integration-in-bitcoin-core-and-hwi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/hardware-wallet-integration-in-bitcoin-core-and-hwi/</guid><description>Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:46

&lt;p>The LOT parameter can be set to either &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; (LOT=true) or &amp;lsquo;false&amp;rsquo; (LOT=false). LOT=false resembles how several previous soft forks were activated. Miners would have one year to coordinate Taproot activation through hash power; if and when a supermajority (probably 90 percent) of miners signal readiness for the upgrade, the soft fork will activate. But if this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen within (probably) a year, the upgrade will expire. (After which it could be redeployed.) LOT=true also lets miners activate the soft fork through hash power, but if they fail to do this within that year, nodes will activate the soft fork regardless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Van Wirdum and Provoost discussed the benefits and detriments of each option. This also includes possible scenarios of what could happen if some users set LOT to true, while other users set LOT to false, and the associated risks. Finally, the hosts discussed what they think is most likely going to happen with Taproot activation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Explaining Bitcoin Addresses</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/explaining-bitcoin-addresses/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/explaining-bitcoin-addresses/</guid><description>Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:45

Aaron and Sjors explain three advantages of RBF: the option the “speed up” a transaction (1), which can in turn result in a more effective fee market for block space (2), as well as the potential to make more efficient use of block space by updating transactions to include more recipients (3). The main disadvantage of RBF is that it makes it slightly easier to double spend unconfirmed transactions, which was also at the root of last week’s “double spend” controversy that dominated headlines. Aaron and Sjors discuss some solutions to diminish this risk, including “opt-in RBF” which is currently implemented in Bitcoin Core. Finally, Sjors explains in detail how opt-in RBF works in Bitcoin Core, and which conditions must be met before a transaction is considered replaceable. He also notes some complications with this version of RBF, for example in the context of the Lightning Network.</description></item><item><title>Compact Client Side Filtering (Neutrino)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/compact-client-side-filtering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/compact-client-side-filtering/</guid><description>Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:34

&lt;p>In theory, the fact that most Bitcoin nodes, wallets and applications are open source should ensure that developers can’t include malicious code in the programs: anyone can inspect the source code for malware. In practice, however, the number of people with enough expertise to do this is limited, while the reliance of some Bitcoin projects on external code libraries (“dependencies”) makes it even harder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, even if the open-source code is sound, this doesn’t guarantee that the binaries (computer code) really correspond with the open-source code. Van Wirdum and Provoost explain how this risk is largely mitigated in Bitcoin through a process called Gitian building, where several Bitcoin Core developers sign the binaries if, and only if, they all produced the exact same binaries from the same source code. This requires special compiler software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the hosts discuss Guix, a relatively new project that goes above and beyond the Gitian process to minimize the level of trust required to turn source code into binaries — including trust in the compiler itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RSK, Federated Sidechains And Powpeg</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/rsk-federated-sidechains-and-powpeg/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/rsk-federated-sidechains-and-powpeg/</guid><description>In this episode of The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado, hosts Aaron van Wirdum and Sjors Provoost discuss RSK’s shift from a federated sidechain model to the project’s new Powpeg solution.

Eclipse attacks isolate a node, controlling its network connections to manipulate transaction visibility and block information. The transcript outlines the mechanism of these attacks, including the strategic overflow of a node&amp;rsquo;s address list and inducing node restarts. It also covers the potential for facilitating double-spend attacks and splitting the miner network. Mitigation strategies implemented in Bitcoin Core are discussed, including improvements in peer selection and connection management. These measures increase the resilience of the network against eclipse attacks by reducing attackers&amp;rsquo; ability to monopolize a node&amp;rsquo;s view of the blockchain, showcasing the ongoing efforts to secure Bitcoin against such vulnerabilities.</description></item><item><title>Open Timestamps: Leveraging Bitcoin's Security For All Data</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/open-timestamps-leveraging-bitcoin-s-security-for-all-data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/open-timestamps-leveraging-bitcoin-s-security-for-all-data/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this episode of The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado, Aaron and Sjors discuss Open Timestamps, a Bitcoin-based time stamping project from applied cryptography consultant and former Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd. Open Timestamps leverages the security of the Bitcoin blockchain to timestamp any type of data, allowing for irrefutable proof that that data existed at a particular point in time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aaron and Sjors explain that virtually any amount of data can, in fact, be timestamped in the Bitcoin blockchain at minimal cost because Open Timestamps leverages Merkle trees, the cryptographic trick to aggregate data into a single, compact hash. This hash is then included in a Bitcoin transaction, making all of the data aggregated into the hash as immutable as any other Bitcoin transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Todd offered an interesting showcase of Open Timestamps earlier this week, as he proved that the public key used by Google to sign “the email&amp;quot; to Hunter Biden indeed existed in 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aaron and Sjors also discuss some of the other possibilities that a time-stamping system like Open Timestamps offers, as well as its limitations. Finally, Aaron provides a little bit of context for the history of cryptographic time stamping, which was itself referenced in the Bitcoin white paper&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is Utreexo?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/what-is-utreexo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/what-is-utreexo/</guid><description>The discussion revolves around Utreexo, a novel proposal aimed at enhancing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s scalability by optimizing the UTXO set storage through a compact, Merkle tree-based structure. Utreexo seeks to address the challenges of node synchronization speeds and RAM usage by allowing nodes to store a much smaller representation of the UTXO set, thus potentially accelerating the syncing process and making the network more efficient. The conversation delves into the technical mechanisms of Utreexo, its implementation challenges, and the practical benefits it offers, including reduced memory requirements and the facilitation of faster node operations. While acknowledging Utreexo&amp;rsquo;s promising advantages for Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s scalability, the participants also weigh its potential downsides, such as increased bandwidth for block transmission and the necessity for significant network adoption to realize its full benefits.</description></item><item><title>Sync Bitcoin Faster! Assume UTXO</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/sync-bitcoin-faster-assume-utxo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/sync-bitcoin-faster-assume-utxo/</guid><description>&lt;p>On this episode of The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado, Aaron and Sjors discuss “Assume UTXO,” a proposal and project by Chaincode Labs alumnus James O’Beirne.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest, if not the biggest, bottlenecks for scaling Bitcoin is initial block download: the time it takes for a Bitcoin node to synchronize with the Bitcoin network, as it needs to process all historic transactions and blocks in order to construct the latest UTXO-set: the current state of bitcoin-ownership.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aaron and Sjors explain some of the ways sync-time has been sped up over time. First, sync-time was improved through “Headers First” synchronization, which ensures that new Bitcoin nodes don’t waste time validating (potentially) weaker blockchains. In recent years, sync-time has been improved with “Assume Valid,” an optional shortcut that lets nodes skip signature verification of older transactions, instead trusting that the Bitcoin Core development process in combination with the resource-expensive nature of mining offers a reliable version of transaction history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, they explain how the security assumptions underpinning Assume Valid could be extended to allow for the potential future upgrade Assume UTXO to offer new Bitcoin Core users a speedy solution to get up to speed with the Bitcoin network, sacrificing a minimal amount of security during the initial bootstrapping phase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core 0.21 Supports Tor V3</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v21-supports-tor-v3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v21-supports-tor-v3/</guid><description>Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:07

Miniscript is described as a template of Bitcoin Script, aimed at making it easier to write, analyze, and reason about Bitcoin smart contracts. The discussion covers the basics of Bitcoin Script, its problems such as complexity and potential for errors, and how Miniscript addresses these issues by providing a standardized way to use a subset of Bitcoin Script&amp;rsquo;s functionality. The episode also introduces the concept of a policy language, a higher-level programming language that can be compiled into Miniscript, facilitating even easier script creation for developers. Additionally, the limitations of Miniscript and its place within the Bitcoin ecosystem are discussed, highlighting its role as a tool for developers rather than a consensus change.</description></item><item><title>Breaking Down Taproot Activation Options</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/breaking-down-taproot-activation-options/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/breaking-down-taproot-activation-options/</guid><description>This podcast episode delves into the nuances of Bitcoin soft fork activation, with a particular focus on the upcoming Taproot activation.

How much should Bitcoin Core do, and how much should other libraries do? Andrew Chow wrote the wonderful HWI tool. Right now we have a pull request to support external signers. The HWI script can talk to most major hardware wallets because it has all the drivers built in now, and it can get keys from it, and sign arbitrary transactions. That&amp;rsquo;s roughly what it does.
