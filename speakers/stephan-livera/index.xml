So there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on. I think the conversation around learning to self custody is always an important one. It&amp;rsquo;s always one that&amp;rsquo;s very fresh on my mind as well. And so we&amp;rsquo;re seeing a lot of discussion. And I think recently, of course, there was the news about Luke Dash-jr losing his coins, I think, I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how many, but probably something in the range of 200 bitcoins, so a serious amount of coin.</description></item><item><title>OP_Vault - A New Way to HODL?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</guid><description>Stephan:

Hey, Stephan, it&amp;rsquo;s great to be back. I think it&amp;rsquo;s been almost four years.

Damn. Yeah, well, in terms of on the show, yeah, actually in person, you know, a couple of times, some of the conferences and things. But I know you&amp;rsquo;ve got this awesome proposal out, and it looks pretty interesting to me, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure SLP listeners will be very interested to hear more about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
