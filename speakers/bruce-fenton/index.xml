Bitcoin Association Guy (BAG)
BAG: I&amp;rsquo;m here with Bruce Fenton and Tone Vays. Bruce is also host of the Satoshi Roundtable and a long-term investor. Tone Vays is a derivatives trader and content creator. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about Wall Street. I believe you&amp;rsquo;re both based in NY? How was the last 12 months?
TV: I own an apartment there, but I think I spent 9 months a year everywhere else.</description></item></channel></rss>
