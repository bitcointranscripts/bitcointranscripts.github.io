Stephan Livera:
So Jeremy, welcome to the show.
Jeremy Rubin:
Yeah, thanks for having me on.
Stephan Livera:
So Jeremy, you’ve been chatting a little bit and obviously building on this idea of Check Template Verify, and I think there’s a lot of people in the community who would really benefit from hearing from you exactly what it is, and talking a little bit about this journey of how you came to where it is now.</description></item><item><title>Covenants</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/</guid><description>Topic: Covenants

Intro (Udi Wertheimer) Today we are joined by Jeremy Rubin who is a Bitcoin Core contributor and the co-founder of the MIT Bitcoin Project. He is involved in a tonne of other cool stuff. He is also championing BIP 119 which is OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. He is going to tell us about that and how it allows for new types of smart contracts.</description></item><item><title>CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-02-11-jeremy-rubin-ctv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-02-11-jeremy-rubin-ctv/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Podcast

Intro Jonas: Welcome to the podcast Jeremy.
Jeremy: Thanks for having me on.
Jonas: I think to start us off tell us a bit about your background, how you got into Bitcoin and we&amp;rsquo;ll take it from there.
Jeremy: I first heard about Bitcoin in 2011. I was interning at MIT during high school and I was doing what interns do which is read Hacker News.</description></item><item><title>SIGHASH_NOINPUT, ANYPREVOUT</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-06-noinput-etc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-06-noinput-etc/</guid><description>SIGHASH_NOINPUT, ANYPREVOUT, OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK, OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY, and OP_SECURETHEBAG

There&amp;rsquo;s apparently some political messaging around OP_SECURETHEBAG and &amp;ldquo;secure the bag&amp;rdquo; might be an Andrew Yang thing.
SIGHASH_NOINPUT A bunch of us are familiar with NOINPUT. Does anyone need an explainer? What&amp;rsquo;s the difference from the original NOINPUT and the new one? NOINPUT is kind of scary to at least some people. If we just do NOINPUT, does that start causing problems in bitcoin?</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2018-04-23-jeremy-rubin-bitcoin-core/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2018-04-23-jeremy-rubin-bitcoin-core/</guid><description>A hardCORE workout

Intro Thank you very much for the warm welcome. So welcome to the hard core workout. It is not going to be that difficult but you can stretch if you need to. It is going to be a lot of material so I’m going to go a little bit fast. If you have any questions feel free to stop me in the middle. There’s a lot of material to get through so I might say “Hold it” or “Find me after” but if there is anything that would help your understanding fee free to classroom style raise your hand and I’ll try to answer it.</description></item><item><title>Covenants - Structuring Multi Transaction Contracts in Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/2017-01-26-jeremy-rubin-covenants/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/2017-01-26-jeremy-rubin-covenants/</guid><description>Structuring Multi Transaction Contracts in Bitcoin
Location: BPASE 2017, Stanford University
Slides: https://rubin.io/public/pdfs/multi-txn-contracts.pdf
Intro Hey everyone. How is it going? Happy to be going last right now given that I had all these wonderful speakers before me to explain so much of what I am about to tell you. I’m going to talk to you today about structuring multi-transaction contracts in Bitcoin. I think there is a lot of great work that happens in Bitcoin at the script level, at the individual input and output.</description></item><item><title>Bip Securethebag</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/bip-securethebag/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/bip-securethebag/</guid><description>BIP: OP_SECURETHEBAG

Introduction Thank you for the introduction. Today I am going to talk to you about OP_SECURETHEBAG. It&amp;rsquo;s research that I have been working on for the last couple years. I think it&amp;rsquo;s very exciting and hopefully it will have a big compact. I have a lot of slides.
Why are we here? We are here for scaling bitcoin. The goal we have is to scale bitcoin. What is scaling, though?</description></item><item><title>CTV BIP Review Workshop</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/ctv-bip-review-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/ctv-bip-review-workshop/</guid><description>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY workshop notes

Introduction Howdy livestreamers. Can someone just tweet that the livestream has actually started? https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin/status/1223672458516938752 Okay thanks.
Welcome to the OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY workshop. In the email I mentioned that we do have a code of conduct. It boils down to &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t be a jerk&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Spork Probabilistic Bitcoin Soft Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/spork-probabilistic-bitcoin-soft-forks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/spork-probabilistic-bitcoin-soft-forks/</guid><description>Spork: Probabilistic bitcoin soft-forks
Introduction Thank you for the introduction. I have a secret. I am not an economist, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to forgive me if I don&amp;rsquo;t have your favorite annotations today. I have my own annotations. I originally gave a predecessor to this talk in Japan. You might notice my title here is a haiku: these are protocols used for changing the bitcoin netwokr protocols. People do highly value staying together for a chain, we&amp;rsquo;re doing coordinated activation of a new upgrade.</description></item></channel></rss>
