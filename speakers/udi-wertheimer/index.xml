Introduction You&amp;rsquo;re not going to walk out of here as a privacy protocol developer. I am going to mention and talk about some ideas in some protocols that exist. What I find myself is that of really smart people working on a lot of pretty cool stuff that can make privacy easier and better to use. A lot of times, application developers or exchanges aren&amp;rsquo;t even aware of those things and as a result the end result is that people just sometimes use bitcoin in very non-private ways because they&amp;rsquo;re not aware of how to do privacy.</description></item><item><title>Breaking Wasabi</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-wasabi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-wasabi/</guid><description>Breaking wasabi and automated wallets

Trigger warnings Before I begin, some have told me that sometimes I tend to be toxic or provocative. So let&amp;rsquo;s start with some trigger warnings. This presentation might include bad jokes about bitcoin personalitites. It might have some multiplication. I might say &amp;ldquo;ethereum&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s also a coinjoin warning. If this is triggering to you, then it&amp;rsquo;s okay to leave.</description></item></channel></rss>
