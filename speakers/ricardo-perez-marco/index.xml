Overview I am going to talk about what I understand to be decentralized network. Fabrice has already explained most of what is LN about and some history about it. I will just recall a few properties that I need in order to address the mathematical problem of routing.</description></item><item><title>Selfish mining and Dyck words</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/selfish-mining/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/selfish-mining/</guid><description>Introduction I am going to talk about our recent work on selfish mining. I am going to explain the profitability model, the different mathematical models that are used to analyze selfish mining with their properties.
