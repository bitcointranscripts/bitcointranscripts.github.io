Overview I am going to talk about what I understand to be decentralized network. Fabrice has already explained most of what is LN about and some history about it. I will just recall a few properties that I need in order to address the mathematical problem of routing.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Selfish Mining and Dyck Words</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/selfish-mining/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/selfish-mining/</guid><description>Introduction I am going to talk about our recent work on selfish mining. I am going to explain the profitability model, the different mathematical models that are used to analyze selfish mining with their properties.
Bibliography On profitability of selfish mining On profitability of stubborn mining On profitability of trailing mining Bitcoin selfish mining and Dyck words Selfish mining and Dyck words in bitcoin and ethereum networks Selfish mining in ethereum The paper on selfish mining in ethereum is even more complex.</description></item></channel></rss>
