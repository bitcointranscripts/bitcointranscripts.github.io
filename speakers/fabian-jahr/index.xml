Introduction I am pretty sure you can tell but I am not James (Chiang). I am taking over the functional testing framework talk from James. He has already given several great talks. I took over this talk at very short notice from James. I’d like to give a hands on talk.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/debugging-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/debugging-bitcoin/</guid><description>Topic: Debugging Bitcoin

Introduction I am going to talk about debugging Bitcoin. Of course if you want to contribute to Bitcoin there are a lot of conceptual things that you have to understand in order to do that. Most of the talks here today and tomorrow are about that. But actually writing code or fixing stuff, you will also have to learn some things on a practical level.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Workshop</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-fabian-jahr-debugging-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-fabian-jahr-debugging-workshop/</guid><description>Topic: Debugging Bitcoin Core Workshop

Introduction First of all welcome to the debugging Bitcoin Core workshop. Everything I know more or less about using a debugger to learn from Bitcoin Core and to fix problems in Bitcoin Core. I didn’t go with traditional slides because I want to teach you how to use this tool, the debugger, in the context of Bitcoin Core.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Bitcoin Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-22-fabian-jahr-debugging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-22-fabian-jahr-debugging/</guid><description>Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/Debugging_Bitcoin.pdf

Introduction I’m talking about debugging Bitcoin and that means to me using loggers and debugging tools to work with Bitcoin and this is especially useful for somebody who is a beginner with Bitcoin development. Or even a beginner for C++ which I considered myself a couple of weeks ago actually. I’m going to tell the story of a fictional beginner to Bitcoin development. This disclaimer, while you may think you recognize some names just assume everything is made up because I made it all up.</description></item></channel></rss>
