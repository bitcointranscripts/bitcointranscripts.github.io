CL: Thank you Elizabeth and Stacy for that great talk. Who runs a lightning node here? So a lot of you. Are you guys excited about lightning? Great, we have like four more talks on lightning. Next we have Will O&amp;rsquo;Beirne who will be talking about lightning payments on the web. Big round of applause.

LC: Can everyone hear me now? Alright, alright.
WO: It&amp;rsquo;s getting some good usage. A lot of those are businesses. Definitely it&amp;rsquo;s in the early stage. Elizabeth talked about this. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things that are mostly for fun, it&amp;rsquo;s not really at ecommerce yet.
LC: That&amp;rsquo;s for lnd?
WO: Sure, and I think Lisa can talk about c-lightning.
LC: I like these different implementations for LN.</description></item></channel></rss>
