In the bitcoin world, there are a couple common ways of paying someone. Making a payment is such a basic thing. &amp;hellip; The alternative we have is that you can generate a single address and put it in your twitter profile and everyone can pay you, but that&amp;rsquo;s not private.</description></item><item><title>Succinct Atomic Swap</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/ruben-somsen/2020-05-11-ruben-somsen-succinct-atomic-swap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/ruben-somsen/2020-05-11-ruben-somsen-succinct-atomic-swap/</guid><description>Topic: Succinct Atomic Swap (SAS)

Intro Happy halvening. Today I have a special technical presentation for you. Basically what we are going to do is cut atomic swaps in half. I call this succinct atomic swaps.
Motivation First let me tell you my motivation. I think Bitcoin is a very important technology. We need to find ways to utilize it at its maximum potential without sacrificing decentralization.</description></item><item><title>Statechains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-07-statechains/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-07-statechains/</guid><description>Blind statechains: UTXO transfer with a blind signing server

Introduction I am going to talk casually through the whole statechains thing. If you want to interject, please do. I&amp;rsquo;ll get started. The current idea is to make it completely blind. It&amp;rsquo;s blinded statechains. The goal is to allow people to transfer a UTXO without changing anything on-chain.</description></item><item><title>Statechains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/statechains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/statechains/</guid><description>Schnorr signatures, adaptor signatures and statechains
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171345418237685760
Introduction If you want to know the details of statechains, I recommend checking out my talk from Breaking Bitcoin 2019 Amsterdam. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a quick recap of Schnorr signatures and adaptor signatures and then statechains. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand Schnorr signatures to the point where you&amp;rsquo;re really comfortable with it. A lot of the cool stuff in bitcoin right now is related to or using Schnorr signatures.</description></item><item><title>Statechains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/statechains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/statechains/</guid><description>Statechains: Off-chain transfer of UTXOs
I am the education director of readingbitcoin.org, and I am going to be talking about statechains for off-chain transfer of UTXOs.

Statechains This is another layer 2 scaling solution, by avoiding on-chain transactions. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to lightning network. The difference is that coin movement is not restricted. You deon&amp;rsquo;t have these channels where you have to have a path and send an exact amount. There&amp;rsquo;s some synergy with lightning; it&amp;rsquo;s not a replacement for lightning.</description></item></channel></rss>
