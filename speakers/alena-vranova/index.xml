V: Hello and welcome to this amazing conference. It&amp;rsquo;s a good conference, come on. It&amp;rsquo;s great because you can ask them about UASF and they know what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about. I have some guests with me today. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talkin gabout merchant processing and talk about regular bitcoin adoption too. The first question I have for Alena is, &amp;hellip; there was a big effort in the early days of bitcoin to onboard merchants and get them on and people thought this was how bitcoin was going to win.</description></item><item><title>The B Foundation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-b-foundation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-b-foundation/</guid><description>The B Foundation

I think most people here have some idea of who I am. I am a long-term bitcoiner. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in bitcoin since 2010. I love bitcoin. I am passionate about it. I want to see it grow and prosper. The positive thing about bitcoin is that it has a resilient ecosystem. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any CEO. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any centralized organization and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any central point to direct where it is going.</description></item></channel></rss>
