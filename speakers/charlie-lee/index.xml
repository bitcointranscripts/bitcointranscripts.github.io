So. So um. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s. I got extremely excited that the expo is at 26100. This was one of my favorite classrooms. Almost 20 years ago, I took 1802 with Professor Rogers. Yeah. I hope I am not as boring as he was back then.
Another thing I remember about this classroom is that we watched a lot of LS movies.</description></item></channel></rss>
