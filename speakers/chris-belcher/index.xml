Chris Belcher rejoins me on the show to talk about Bitcoin Surveillance companies, and what risks they present to Bitcoin. We also talk about JoinMarket fidelity bonds. Stephan Livera:
Chris, welcome back to the show.
Chris Belcher:
Thanks for having me.
Stephan Livera:
So, Chris, I know you have been vocal recently in your criticism of Bitcoin surveillance companies. And I share your views on this. I thought it would be good to just have some discussion from the Bitcoin holder perspective.</description></item><item><title>Defending Bitcoin Privacy</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-11-chris-belcher/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-11-chris-belcher/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/58/
Stephan Livera: My guest today is Chris Belcher, Bitcoin privacy O.G. He’s been in the game a long time, and has made great contributions on privacy. He’s involved with JoinMarket, Electrum Personal Server, and most recently he wrote, or rather updated, a fantastic Bitcoin privacy Wiki which you simply must read. Here is my interview with Chris. Chris, welcome to the show.
Chris Belcher: Hello, thanks for having me.</description></item><item><title>Breaking Bitcoin Privacy</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-bitcoin-privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-bitcoin-privacy/</guid><description>0A8B 038F 5E10 CC27 89BF CFFF EF73 4EA6 77F3 1129

Introduction Hello everybody. I invented and created joinmarket, the first really popular coinjoin implementation. A couple months ago I wrote a big literature review on privacy. It has everything about anything in privacy in bitcoin, published on the bitcoin wiki. This talk is about privacy and what we can do to improve it.
Why privacy? Privacy is essential for fungibility, a necessary property of money where one unit is always equal to any other unit.</description></item></channel></rss>
