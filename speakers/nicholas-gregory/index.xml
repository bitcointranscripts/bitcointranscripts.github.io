Stephan Livera:
Nicholas welcome to the show.
Nicholas Gregory:
Hello. Thanks for having me.
Stephan Livera:
So Nicholas, there’s discussion in the community around scaling and how do things scale, and also how do we get more privacy in the Bitcoin ecosystem? I think these are ideas that people are talking about, and I know you’re working on some stuff that’s obviously very relevant for that as well with statechains, Mercury wallet, and stuff like that.</description></item></channel></rss>
