I&amp;rsquo;m one of the co-founders at Rigly, and we are a peer-to-peer hashrate market. The way this talk is kind of broken up is the first part we&amp;rsquo;re going to go through what is hash rate, how the protocol for mining works across the network, and then a little bit on how hash rate markets have come around, and then finally how we can potentially do hash rate with root layer two, which is obviously given the kind of subject matter of the conference.</description></item></channel></rss>
