He is the head at Spiral. He&amp;rsquo;s done a lot of open source development. He talks to a bunch of people. He&amp;rsquo;s also the PM for the LDK team. So we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk Lightning, the challenges that are open with Lightning, and maybe a little bit about other projects in the space.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Grants, Design &amp; Crypto Patents (COPA)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-09-15-steve-lee-of-square-crypto/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-09-15-steve-lee-of-square-crypto/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/211/
