I would like to thank the organizers for giving this opportunity to learn so much from my peers and colleagues some of which are here. This is a wonderful survey of many of the works in this area. As I was sitting here, I was in real-time adjusting my slides to minimize the overlap. I will cut down on the amount of introduction because what we just saw (Mike Walfish) was wonderful.</description></item></channel></rss>
