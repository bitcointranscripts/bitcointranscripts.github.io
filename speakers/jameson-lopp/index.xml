I am going to do a brain dump of basically anything that people who are building systems protecting private keys are thinking about. Hopefully you can ingest this for when you decide to build one of these systems.
If you have been in this space for long at all, you should be well aware that there are risks for trusting third-parties. Various entities are trying to centralize aspects of this system.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 Closing Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/day-1-closing-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/day-1-closing-panel/</guid><description>Closing panel

RS: Thanks guys for joining the panel. We just need to get one more chair. I am going to introduce Alex Petrov here because everyone else was on stage. The closing panel is going to be an overview of what&amp;rsquo;s happening in bitcoin. I want to start with the question I started with last year. What is the current state of bitcoin compared to last year? What has happened?</description></item><item><title>Extreme Opsec For The Modern Cypherpunk</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/extreme-opsec-for-the-modern-cypherpunk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/extreme-opsec-for-the-modern-cypherpunk/</guid><description>Extreme opsec for the modern cypherpunk
Jameson is the infrastructure engineer at Casa. Please welcome Jameson Lopp.
Introduction Hi fellow cypherpunks. We&amp;rsquo;re under attack. Corporations and nation states in their quest for omniscience have slowly stripped away our privacy. We are the frog being boiled in the pot called progress. We can&amp;rsquo;t trust that corporations will grant us privacy out of their beneficience. Our failures here are our own. After being swatted a year ago, I set out to restart my life with a new focus on privacy.</description></item></channel></rss>
