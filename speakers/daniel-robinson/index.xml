Introduction I am here to talk about a design pattern that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. You see HTLCs a lot. You see them in a lot of protocols for cross-chain atomic exchanges and payment channel networks such as lightning. But they have some downsides, which people aren&amp;rsquo;t all familiar with. I am not affiliated with Interledger, but they convinced me that HTLCs were a bad idea and they developed an alternative to replace HTLCs.</description></item></channel></rss>
