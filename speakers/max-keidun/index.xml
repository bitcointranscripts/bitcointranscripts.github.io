Hey guys, next talk in 5 minutes. In five minutes.
Introduction Hello everyone. If you&amp;rsquo;re walking, please do it in silence. I am a bit nervous. I was too busy organizing this conference and didn&amp;rsquo;t get time for this talk. If you had high expectatoins for this presentation, then please lower them for the next 20 minutes. I was going to talk about the traditional VC models and why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in the bitcoin industry.</description></item></channel></rss>
