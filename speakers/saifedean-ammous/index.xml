Introduction Saife saved my life. Until I met Saife, and had him on my show and talked to him, I was a shitcoiner. Okay? Sorry guys. I am going to lay it out there. He talked to me, he came on my show, he sent me his book, his writings, and before I knew it, I started something I really wanted to share with everyone.
Real introduction Okay, thank you everyone and Gerry for inviting me.</description></item><item><title>The Bitcoin Standard</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-bitcoin-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-bitcoin-standard/</guid><description>The bitcoin standard as a layered scaling solution
