Stephan Livera: Thomas, welcome to the show.
Thomas Voegtlin: Thank you for having me.
Stephan Livera: So Tom I had the pleasure of meeting you at Berlin as part of the lightning conference. And I was really keen to discuss with you and talk about Electrum because obviously it’s one of the longstanding wallets in the space. Thomas, can you give us a little bit of your background and your story on how you came into Bitcoin and how you started Electrum?</description></item><item><title>Light Clients During 2017 Interfork Period</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/light-clients-during-2017-interfork-period/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/light-clients-during-2017-interfork-period/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1005617123287289857
Next up is Thomas.
Introduction Alright. Hello everyone. Thank you for having me. I&amp;rsquo;m the developer of the Electrum wallet. I started this project in 2011. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about lite clients and the implication of the 2017 hard-fork. We might be in the middle of two forks at the moment.
So we have segwit and we are very happy about that. ((applause)) This graph was taken from Pieter Wuille&amp;rsquo;s website.</description></item></channel></rss>
