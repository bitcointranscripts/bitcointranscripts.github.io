Thank you, Samson, for that great introduction and thank you for organizing this awesome event. It&amp;rsquo;s great seeing everyone. A few years ago, the situation was extremely different. When Samson originally asked me to give a talk, I kind of thought a little bit about what I should talk about and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what&amp;rsquo;s most interesting. A few years ago, it was much more clear about the set of things going on.</description></item><item><title>Changing Consensus Rules Without Breaking Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/changing-consensus-rules-without-breaking-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/changing-consensus-rules-without-breaking-bitcoin/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1005822360321216512
Introduction I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about &amp;hellip; we actually discovered we can replace the script completely with soft-forks.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note this quote from satoshi, from summer 2010: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe a second compatible implementation will ever&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
Comparing open-source development to bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s blockchain &amp;hellip; a lot of the inspiration came from the development of open-source. All source code is public, analogous to all blockchain being public. All changes are logged, same as all ledger additions, and subject to audit.</description></item><item><title>The Great Debate Whalepool</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2016-12-14-whalepool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2016-12-14-whalepool/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/809174512105295872

KW: We have some wonderful panelists today. Let&amp;rsquo;s kick it off. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Eric. Who are you and what role do you play in bitcoin development?
EL: I got into bitcoin in 2011. I had my own network stack. I almost had a full node implementation but I stopped short because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as well tested or reviewed as Bitcoin Core. So I started to look into the community a little bit.</description></item><item><title>Build Scale Operate</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/build-scale-operate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/build-scale-operate/</guid><description>Build - Scale - Operate: The Three Pillars of the Bitcoin Community

Good morning. This is such a beautiful conference. Eric and I are excited to speak with you. We are going to outline what our goals are. We want to be clear that we&amp;rsquo;re not here to define vision. Rather, we&amp;rsquo;re here about how to grow vision around how to grow bitcoin from a technical community perspectives. We&amp;rsquo;re going to share some of our challenges with bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Extensibility</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/extensibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/extensibility/</guid><description>Extensibility, fraud proofs, and security models

How many of you have read the Satoshi whitepaper? It&amp;rsquo;s a good paper. As we have discovered, it has some serious limitations that we think can be fixed but they are serious challenges for scaling. Amongst these are, it was really built as a single code base which was meant to be run in its entirety. All machines were going to participate equally in this p2p network.</description></item></channel></rss>
