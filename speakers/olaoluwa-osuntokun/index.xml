Location: Virtual Reality (VR Bitcoin)
Intro (Laolu Osuntokun) Thanks everyone for coming. This is my first time doing a VR presentation, really cool. I am going to be talking about lnd 0.10. Right now we are on rc2, the next major lnd release, it has a bunch of cool features, bug fixes, optimizations. I am going to talk about some big ticket features in 0.10. There are a bunch of other features that you are going to want to check out in the release notes.</description></item><item><title>General discussion on SIGHASH_NOINPUT, OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK, and OP_SECURETHEBAG</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-06-noinput-etc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-06-noinput-etc/</guid><description>SIGHASH_NOINPUT, ANYPREVOUT, OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK, OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY, and OP_SECURETHEBAG

There&amp;rsquo;s apparently some political messaging around OP_SECURETHEBAG and &amp;ldquo;secure the bag&amp;rdquo; might be an Andrew Yang thing.
SIGHASH_NOINPUT A bunch of us are familiar with NOINPUT. Does anyone need an explainer? What&amp;rsquo;s the difference from the original NOINPUT and the new one? NOINPUT is kind of scary to at least some people. If we just do NOINPUT, does that start causing problems in bitcoin?</description></item><item><title>Lnd</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/noded-podcast/2018-12-14-laolu-conner-lnd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/noded-podcast/2018-12-14-laolu-conner-lnd/</guid><description>Noded podcast with Laolu Osuntokun and Conner Fromknecht - December 14th 2018

The Genesis of lnd First, the genesis of lnd. Here is the first commit of lnd. It was October 27 2015. This is when I was in school still. This was done when I went on break and it was the first major…. we had in terms of code. We talked about the language we’re using, the licensing, the architecture of the daemon. A fun fact, the original name of lnd was actually called Plasma.</description></item><item><title>Hardening Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/hardening-lightning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/hardening-lightning/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/959155562134102016

Introduction I am basically going to go over some ways that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about basically hardening lightning network, in terms of making security better and making the client more scalable itself, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about some issues and pain points that come up when you&amp;rsquo;re doing fees on mainnet. And there&amp;rsquo;s going to be some relatively minor changes that I propose to Bitcoin in this talk.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Script 2.0 And Strengthened Payment Channels</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/bitcoin-script-v2.0-and-strengthened-payment-channels/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/bitcoin-script-v2.0-and-strengthened-payment-channels/</guid><description>This is a brief history of bitcoin script evolution. Since bitcoin was active in 2009, there was a lot of emergency fixes for the first 2 years done by Satoshi. He found that people could skpi the signature check using OP_RETURN and malformed scriptSigs. So those functions were removed. OP_VER and OP_VERIF were intended for script upgrades but it was found that after every release of bitcoin, it would become a hard-fork because of the design.</description></item><item><title>Neutrino: The Privacy Preserving Bitcoin Light Client</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-06-06-laolu-osuntokun-neutrino/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-06-06-laolu-osuntokun-neutrino/</guid><description>Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vjJUWOZIaPshjx1svfE6rFZ2lC07n47ifOdzpKWqpb4/

Introduction My name is Laolu or Roasbeef on the internet. I’m going to talk about light clients in general and then also what we’re working on in terms of light clients and then also how that factors into the lightning network itself. The talk is called Neutrino because that is the name of our new light client that has been released. There has been a BIP proposal and I’ll go through all of that in the talk itself.</description></item><item><title>Security Analysis of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/lightning-network-security-analysis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/lightning-network-security-analysis/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/957978915515092992

Introduction My name is Laolu Osuntokun and I work on lightning stuff. I go by roasbeef on the internet. I work at Lightning Labs. I am going to be giving an overview of some security properties and privacy properties of lightning.
State of the hash-lock Before I start, I want to go over the state of the hash-lock which is the current progress to completion and design of lightning.</description></item><item><title>Onion Routing In Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/onion-routing-in-lightning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/onion-routing-in-lightning/</guid><description>http://lightning.network/

Privacy-preserving decentralized micropayments
We&amp;rsquo;re excited about lightning because the second layer could be an important opportunity to improve privacy and fungibility. Also, there might be timing information in the payments themselves.
Distributed set of onion routers (OR, cite OG onionrouting paper). Users create circuits with sub-set of nodes. Difficult for oion routers to gain more info than predecessor+successor in path. Low latency - usable within greater internet. Notable success is tor, notable success of routing nodes.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2016-07-18-laolu-osuntokun-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2016-07-18-laolu-osuntokun-lightning-network/</guid><description>Lightning Network Deep Dive

Introduction My name is Laolu Osuntokun and I work with Lightning guys and you know me as maybe Roasbeef from the internet, on GitHub, Twitter, everything else. I’ve been Roasbeef for the past 8 years and I’m still Roasbeef that’s how it works. I’m going to give you a deep dive into the lightning network. I remember like 2 years ago when I was learning about Bitcoin initially and I went to these Bitcoin dev meetups in Mission and there was a deep dive and Taariq was the MC there, super friendly guy.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Security Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-security-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/lightning-network-security-panel/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137758233865703424
Introduction MF: I will start by thanking Kevin and Lea and the organizers. It&amp;rsquo;s been an awesome event. Thanks also to the sponsors. Without their assistance we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the event. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to make some plugs before we start the conversation. One, I run the London Bitcoin developers group. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in London or interested in speaking, please look up London Bitcoin Devs on Twitter or Meetup.</description></item><item><title>Multi Party Channels In The Utxo Model Challenges And Opportunities</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/multi-party-channels-in-the-utxo-model-challenges-and-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/multi-party-channels-in-the-utxo-model-challenges-and-opportunities/</guid><description>Multi-party channels in the UTXO model: Challenges and opportunities

Introductions Hi. So my name is Laolu. I am also known as roasbeef and I am co-founder of Lightning Labs. I am going to go over some cool research and science fiction. In the actual implementation for these things and cool to discuss and get some discussions around this. first I am going to talk about single-party channels and multi-party channels.</description></item><item><title>The evolution of bitcoin scripting</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/bitcoin-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/bitcoin-script/</guid><description>Agenda opcodes OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK sighash flags keytree sigs MAST graftroot, taproot covenants, reverse covenants (input restrictions: this input has to be spent with tihs other input, or can only be spent if this other one doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist) stack manipulation script languages (simplicity) tx formats, serialization? what would we change with hard-fork changes to the transaction format?
