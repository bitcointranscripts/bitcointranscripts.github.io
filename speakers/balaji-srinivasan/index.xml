PV: Everyone has been asking me to stir you guys up. We have 25 minutes. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time. Which one of you is building betamax?
BS: Bitcoin and blockchain database technology are complementary. I think last year I was much more bearish on private blockchain database technology.</description></item><item><title>How To Get Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/how-to-get-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/how-to-get-bitcoin/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

How to get bitcoin
Balaji Srinivasan
My talk is going to be pretty different from the others. I will try to make this relevant to the blockchain database technology attendees. We&amp;rsquo;re going to talk here today what we call the machine web. It&amp;rsquo;s a web where machines earn bitcoin on each HTTP request. Who here knows what an HTTP request? Every time you load a web page, you make a lot of HTTP requests.</description></item></channel></rss>
