I want to introduce you to James Gatto and Marco Santori with Pilsbury. They will be spending some time talking about Bitcoin law. They have a room this afternoon and they are offering to talk with you one on one. So Marco and James.
You missed the introduction. Was it any good? (laughter)
We are here to talk about legal issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
