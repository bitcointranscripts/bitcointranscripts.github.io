So why don&amp;rsquo;t I start introducing the panel? Tim, hello! Do you want to tell a very brief what do you do?
Tim: Yes, so my name is Tim Ruffing. I am a maintainer of the libsecp256k1 library. I do work for Blockstream, who pay me to do this and also who pay me to do research on cryptography and all kinds of aspects related to Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Atomic Swaps</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/atomic-swaps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/atomic-swaps/</guid><description>The state of atomic swaps

History This should be easy to follow. I want to start off with some history. The first mention of atomic swap concepts was in 2013 in a bitcointalk.org thread where people were wondering how to exchange coins between independent ledgers in a trustless way. There were a few comments on the thread every now and then asking has anyone implemented this. It was quiet until last year when people started doing atomic swaps last year.</description></item><item><title>Scriptless Lotteries</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/scriptless-lotteries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/scriptless-lotteries/</guid><description>Scriptless lotteries on bitcoin from oblivious transfer

Introduction I have no affiliations. I&amp;rsquo;m just some guy. You&amp;rsquo;re trusting a guy to talk about cryptography who got the date wrong. We&amp;rsquo;re doing scriptless bitcoin lotteries from oblivious transfer.
Lotteries Imagine a trusted party who conducts lotteries between Alice and Bob. The goal of the lottery protocol is to use a cryptographic protocol without having a lottery trusted party.</description></item></channel></rss>
