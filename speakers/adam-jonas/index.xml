If we go back in time to version 0.1, all that was stored was the blockchain and I think a marker saying whether that coin was spent or not. I mean that&amp;rsquo;s okay for your first version but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really scale and it&amp;rsquo;s bad performance because every time you want to access a coin you need to read it from disk.
