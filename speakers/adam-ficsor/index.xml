DeLisle explains the adversary tolerance of CJDNS and its use of public keys for communication verification. He also addresses concerns about the environmental impact of crypto mining and argues that it facilitates the transition to renewable energy sources. DeLisle emphasizes the attacks on decentralized finance and crypto by centralized entities and the importance of unity in the crypto community. He highlights the creation of PacketCrypt, a bandwidth-hard proof of work that incentivizes building out large amounts of bandwidth. DeLisle asserts the need to prioritize privacy, robustness, and resilience in the face of attacks and the value of positive engagement with policymakers. He also discusses the differences between CJDNS and other networking solutions, highlighting CJDNS&amp;rsquo;s focus on infrastructure and resilient internet access. In addition, DeLisle mentions the potential for individuals to provide internet access to their neighbors and the financing possibilities for the Packet Network Steward. Finally, he touches on the use of Rust programming language for code review and the productivity improvements it brings in terms of security.</description></item><item><title>CoinShuffle++ (Part 1)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/coinshuffle-plusplus-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/wasabi/research-club/coinshuffle-plusplus-part-1/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s episode Tim Ruffing introduces the CoinShuffle++ protocol and explains its key components. He describes how the protocol uses power sums and polynomial roots to ensure secure messaging between participants. The protocol consists of four stages: Dimi Hellman key exchange, commitment, DC net, and confirmation. The protocol handles malicious peers by revealing secret keys and excluding them in the next round. Ruffing also highlights the scalability of the CoinShuffle++ protocol, as it can accommodate a large number of participants and complete the process in a relatively short time. The use of dice mix enhances the efficiency of the protocol compared to its predecessor, CoinShuffle. Futher Tim dives into the challenges of implementing CoinShuffle++, a decentralized protocol for coinjoining cryptocurrencies. He highlights the issues caused by varying internet connection speeds and round communication, leading to slower performance. Ruffing also discusses concerns about the negotiation process and cryptography affecting communication speed. Additionally, he acknowledges the complexity of the topic and expresses a desire to simplify it for wider understanding and implementation. Overall, Ruffing emphasizes the importance of maintaining privacy in peer-to-peer transactions and the potential of cryptography in various applications.</description></item><item><title>Anonymous Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/anonymous-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/anonymous-bitcoin/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1014128850765303808

One year ago I was standing here at this conference and Igave a talk. Today I am standing here and I titled my talk &amp;ldquo;Anonymous bitcoin&amp;rdquo;. One year ago at this conference, the conference was named &amp;ldquo;breaking bitcoin&amp;rdquo;. I did not break bitcoin. Someone else did, you might remember.
Today I want to present how I build on bitcoin. I have two goals with this presentation. I want to provide a case study of the bitcoin developer and his mistakes and successes.</description></item></channel></rss>
