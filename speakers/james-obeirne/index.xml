As usual, nothing is happening in Bitcoin and we figured, what a great day to put people to sleep in a one to three hour podcast. We don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. We actually don&amp;rsquo;t know how this is going to play out at all. I have here with me Mr. Rijndael. Hello, sir. Welcome back.
Rijndael: 00:01:30
Hello. Good morning.
NVK: 00:01:32
Good morning.</description></item><item><title>OP_VAULT Round 2 &amp; OP_CTV</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</guid><description>The podcast episode discusses the OP_VAULT proposal for enhancing Bitcoin self-custody and security. NVK hosts a panel with James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne, Rijndael, Greg Sanders, and Ben Carman, who delve into the technical aspects and benefits of OP_VAULT. The proposal aims to improve Bitcoin custody by introducing vaults, allowing users to lock their coins with predetermined spend conditions, enhancing security against theft and accidental loss. They compare OP_VAULT with other proposals like CTV and ANYPREVOUT, highlighting its simplicity and operational efficiency. The conversation also addresses potential concerns about covenants and the importance of community engagement and education to facilitate the proposal&amp;rsquo;s acceptance and activation. The episode emphasizes the need for better custody solutions to secure large amounts of Bitcoin, especially as the user base grows and the value of Bitcoin increases.</description></item><item><title>AssumeUTXO update</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-04/2023-04-27-assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-04/2023-04-27-assumeutxo/</guid><description>Goals allow nodes to get a utxo set quickly (1h) at the same time, no major security concessions Approach Provide serialized utxo snapshot get headers chain first, load snapshot and deserialize, sync to tip from that then start background verification with a 2nd snapshot finally, compare hashes when background IBD hits snapshot base Progress update lots of refactoring has been done; ChainStateManager was introduced, globals removed, mempool / blockstorage refactored init / shutdown logic changes have been merged wallet changes done p2p changes still under review (i.</description></item><item><title>Demystifying and Understanding Bitcoin Core Development</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/demystifying-and-understanding-bitcoin-core-development/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/demystifying-and-understanding-bitcoin-core-development/</guid><description>Intro NVK: 00:00:40

Speaker 2: 00:01:05
Hey, good morning. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m here talking about vaults, Bitcoin developer, and I work a lot on multi-sig and vaults that don&amp;rsquo;t use covenants.</description></item><item><title>OP_Vault - A New Way to HODL?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</guid><description>Stephan:

Intros Michael Folkson (MF): This is a discussion on AssumeUTXO. We are lucky to have James O’Beirne on the call. There is a reading list that I will share in a second with a bunch of links going right from concept, some of the podcasts James has done, a couple of presentations James has done. And then towards the end hopefully we will get pretty technical and in the weeds of some of the current, past and future PRs.</description></item><item><title>AssumeUTXO</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/assumeutxo/</guid><description>Next in the studio, we caught James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne, who until recently was a co-worker of ours at Chaincode.

James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne: To sort of vamp off of Jonas&amp;rsquo;s preamble, I&amp;rsquo;m not that smart. I&amp;rsquo;m a decent programmer, but compared to a lot of people who work on Bitcoin, I barely know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I kind of consider myself like a carpenter, a digital carpenter equivalent. I&amp;rsquo;m a steady hand. I can get things done. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly patient, which i s key when it comes to Bitcoin Core development because, trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be doing a lot of waiting around and a lot of rebasing.</description></item><item><title>AssumeUTXO</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137008648620838912
Why assumeutxo assumeutxo is a spiritual continuation of assumevalid. Why do we want to do this in the first place? At the moment, it takes hours and days to do initial block download. Various projects in the community have been implementing meassures to speed this up. Casa I think bundles datadir with their nodes. Other projects like btcpay have various ways of bundling this up and signing things with gpg keys and these solutions are not quite half-baked but they are probably not desirable either.</description></item><item><title>The Truth About 'Power' in Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-04-11-james-obeirne/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-04-11-james-obeirne/</guid><description>Stephan Livera Podcast with James O’Beirne - April 11th 2019
