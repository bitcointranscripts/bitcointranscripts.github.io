As usual, nothing is happening in Bitcoin and we figured, what a great day to put people to sleep in a one to three hour podcast. We don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. We actually don&amp;rsquo;t know how this is going to play out at all. I have here with me Mr. Rijndael. Hello, sir. Welcome back.
Rijndael: 00:01:30
Hello. Good morning.
NVK: 00:01:32

Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to get back to OBVault, just kidding, UpVault, this new awesome proposal on how we can make people&amp;rsquo;s money safe in the future. And in my opinion, one of very good ways of scaling Bitcoin self-custody in a sane way. And with that, let me introduce today&amp;rsquo;s guests, Mr. James. And welcome back.
Speaker 1: 00:01:32
Hey, thanks.

Speaker 2: 00:01:05
Hey, good morning. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m here talking about vaults, Bitcoin developer, and I work a lot on multi-sig and vaults that don&amp;rsquo;t use covenants.</description></item><item><title>OP_Vault - A New Way to HODL?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcointranscripts/stephan-livera-podcast/opvault-a-new-way-to-hodl/</guid><description>Stephan:

Intros Michael Folkson (MF): This is a discussion on AssumeUTXO. We are lucky to have James O’Beirne on the call. There is a reading list that I will share in a second with a bunch of links going right from concept, some of the podcasts James has done, a couple of presentations James has done. And then towards the end hopefully we will get pretty technical and in the weeds of some of the current, past and future PRs.</description></item><item><title>AssumeUTXO</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/assumeutxo/</guid><description>Next in the studio, we caught James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne, who until recently was a co-worker of ours at Chaincode.

James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne: To sort of vamp off of Jonas&amp;rsquo;s preamble, I&amp;rsquo;m not that smart. I&amp;rsquo;m a decent programmer, but compared to a lot of people who work on Bitcoin, I barely know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I kind of consider myself like a carpenter, a digital carpenter equivalent. I&amp;rsquo;m a steady hand. I can get things done. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly patient, which i s key when it comes to Bitcoin Core development because, trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be doing a lot of waiting around and a lot of rebasing.</description></item><item><title>AssumeUTXO</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06/2019-06-07-assumeutxo/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137008648620838912
Why assumeutxo assumeutxo is a spiritual continuation of assumevalid. Why do we want to do this in the first place? At the moment, it takes hours and days to do initial block download. Various projects in the community have been implementing meassures to speed this up. Casa I think bundles datadir with their nodes. Other projects like btcpay have various ways of bundling this up and signing things with gpg keys and these solutions are not quite half-baked but they are probably not desirable either.</description></item><item><title>The Truth About 'Power' in Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-04-11-james-obeirne/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-04-11-james-obeirne/</guid><description>Stephan Livera Podcast with James O’Beirne - April 11th 2019
