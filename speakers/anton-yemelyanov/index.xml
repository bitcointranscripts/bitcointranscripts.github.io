Good morning. Glad to see many of you again. My name is Anton Yemelyanov. I am one of the organizers of this event. On behalf of Scaling Bitcoin planning committee, I would like to welcome everybody here to the third scaling event. We&amp;rsquo;re holding this event here in Milan. Milan has a really vibrant community. It has been a real pleasure working with everyone here to create this event. The goal of Scaling as everybody knows is to get everyone together in a single place, all engineers and academic community so that we can discuss different scaling approaches and see how they can be applied to bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Intro</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/intro/</guid><description>Introduction Stanford 2017

Sorry that we&amp;rsquo;re running a little bit late. My name is Anton Yemelyanov. I am one of the organizers running this event. Welcome everybody. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have a lot of familiar faces here. First of all, as you may know, we have ran over the last 2 days, Bitcoin Edge Dev++ where we have trained over 80 new developers that have joined our ecosystem. They have covered a number of topics including ECDSA and discreet log contracts.</description></item><item><title>Intro</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/intro/</guid><description>Introduction to Scaling Bitcoin Tel Aviv 2019

Introduction
slides: https://tokyo2018.scalingbitcoin.org/presentations
Welcome to scaling bitcoin. This is an international conference. We run the event every year in a different geographical location. We run this event as a strictly academic and engineering conference. The mentality that we take behind the event is think global, act local. It&amp;rsquo;s a well known bitcoin additive. Our goal is to stimulate the bitcoin ecosystem. The best way to do this is to stimulate the engineering community, because that&amp;rsquo;s what drives this magnificent technology for the last almost 10 years now.</description></item></channel></rss>
