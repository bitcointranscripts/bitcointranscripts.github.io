Intro Good evening. My name is James and it is a real privilege to give this talk right after Andrew (Poelstra) has primed the entire audience on Miniscript. That’s pretty awesome. I learned a lot of things even though I coded the stuff that they have on Pieter’s website the actual justification and reasoning behind a lot of the decisions they made in the language were very insightful.</description></item><item><title>Libbitcoin: A practical introduction</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/libbitcoin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/libbitcoin/</guid><description>or: libbitcoin&amp;rsquo;s bx tool: Constructing a raw transaction

Introduction I am going to talk about libbitcoin. It&amp;rsquo;s an alternative implementation of Bitcoin Core. There&amp;rsquo;s a few alternatives out there, like btcd and then bcoin. Libbitcoin is written in C++ and it&amp;rsquo;s the oldest alternative implementation that is out there. I&amp;rsquo;d like to show a few examples of what you can do with libbitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;d like to show how it is designed and give you a sense for its architecture an dalso show some design tradeoffs compared to the original implementation.</description></item><item><title>Build a Taproot</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/taproot/</guid><description>https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YVOYJGmQ_mY-5_Rs0Cu84AYSI6wCvpfIgoapfgsYP2U/edit

Introduction Hi my name is James and I have been a resident here at Chaincode. It has been a privilege. I hear they might be doing it again in the future, I highly recommend the experience, it has been really fantastic. I’ve been working on a demo library in Python for Taproot and that’s why I chose to talk about Taproot and policy today. Seemingly two separate topics but actually there are some very interesting implications for each other.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/hierarchical-deterministic-wallets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/hierarchical-deterministic-wallets/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1047714436889235456

Introduction My name is James Chiang. Quick introduction about myself. My contributions to bitcoin have been on the project libbitcoin where I do documentation. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through the APIs and libraries. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great toolkit. Eric Voskuil is speaking later today and he also works on libbitcoin. I also volunteered to talk about hierarchical deterministic wallets.
When we talk about bitcoin wallets, you always have some kind of secret or entropy you want to keep safe.</description></item></channel></rss>
