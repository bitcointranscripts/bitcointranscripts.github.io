V: Hello and welcome to this amazing conference. It&amp;rsquo;s a good conference, come on. It&amp;rsquo;s great because you can ask them about UASF and they know what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about. I have some guests with me today. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talkin gabout merchant processing and talk about regular bitcoin adoption too. The first question I have for Alena is, &amp;hellip; there was a big effort in the early days of bitcoin to onboard merchants and get them on and people thought this was how bitcoin was going to win.</description></item></channel></rss>
