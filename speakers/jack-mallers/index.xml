Stephan Livera: Jack, welcome to the show, man.
Jack Mallers: Stephan, thank you for having me. I’m a big fan.
Stephan Livera: I’m a big fan of you. I really like what your family’s doing, you know, Bitcoinmom and your dad @willbc20. I can’t remember his exact handle. And then obviously you guys are just killing it. I’m a big fan. Zap is my favorite wallet, so I really love using it and yeah, I’m really looking forward to just chatting with you about Zap and you know what you’re doing as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
