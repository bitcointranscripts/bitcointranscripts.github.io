We are complete. Maybe we can start. So good morning. This is Optech Newsletter #292 Recap. And as you can hear, Mike is not here today and I&amp;rsquo;m filling in as the main host. Today we have four news items, two releases and release candidates, and four PRs to talk about in our notable code and documentation changes. I&amp;rsquo;m Merch and I work at Chaincode Labs and bring you weekly this OpTec newsletter recap.</description></item><item><title>Silent Payments</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/silent-payments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/silent-payments/</guid><description>Silent payments are introduced as a method to enhance Bitcoin transactions&amp;rsquo; privacy and usability by addressing the issue of address reuse. Unlike traditional methods, silent payments use elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to generate unique addresses for each transaction without interaction. This preserves user privacy and simplifies the process. Josibake explains the design rationale, technical challenges, and implementation strategies. He emphasizes the need for widespread adoption of sending capabilities and highlights the potential applications in exchanges and other services. The discussion also covers the trade-offs between privacy and computational overhead, proposing solutions to ensure efficient implementation and user education.</description></item><item><title>Silent Payments</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-04/2023-04-26-silent-payments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-04/2023-04-26-silent-payments/</guid><description>BIP Overview Scanning key and spending key are different: better security. Silent payment transactions are indistinguishable from transactions with taproot outputs on-chain.
Q: Address labeling, why not create two silent payment addresses?
A: It doubles scanning costs.
Limited to taproot UTXOs (currently about 3% of transactions) but when it increases we should find ways to optimize scanning, even though it currently does not seem to be an issue.

Josi, welcome to the show.
Josibake – 00:02:32:
Thanks for having me.
Stephan- 00:02:33:
So, Josi, I know you were keen to chat about I know you’ve been doing a bit of work in the bitcoin development world, doing some mentoring as well, and keen to chat a bit about the process of Bitcoin developer education. Why is it important, all of that. But let’s first start with a little bit about you.</description></item><item><title>The Bitcoin Core wallet and wrangling bitcoin data</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/the-bitcoin-core-wallet-and-wrangling-bitcoin-data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/the-bitcoin-core-wallet-and-wrangling-bitcoin-data/</guid><description>In this conversation, Adam Jonas and Mark Erhardt discuss their work with Josie Baker on Bitcoin data analysis, focusing on mempool data collection and Bitcoin Core wallet improvements. Josie explains his work in standardizing and cleaning mempool data to create a comprehensive, open-source dataset. This dataset will facilitate research and development in areas such as fee estimation and transaction propagation. They also delve into Bitcoin Core wallet enhancements, including privacy improvements and efficient coin selection methods. The conversation highlights the importance of reproducibility, empirical analysis, and open-source collaboration in advancing Bitcoin technology. Josie’s efforts emphasize the value of making Bitcoin data accessible and fostering a community of contributors in the Bitcoin development ecosystem.</description></item></channel></rss>
