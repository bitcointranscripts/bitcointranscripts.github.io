Stephan Livera:
Alejandro welcome to the show.
Alejandro De La Torre:
Thank you, Stephan. Thanks. Thanks for having me.
Stephan Livera:
So Alejandro, I’ve been trying to get you on for a little while, but it just kind of hasn’t happened, but I also want to, I really wanted to chat with you about some of your work you’ve been doing around taproot activation. And obviously this has come quite some way and hopefully it’s looking like it’s pretty close to being signalled, but I’d like to chat a little bit about your process and what it was like for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
