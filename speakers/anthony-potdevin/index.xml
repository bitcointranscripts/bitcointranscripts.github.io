Stephan Livera:
Jestopher and Tony, welcome to the show.
Tony :
Hey, thank you. Thank you for having us.
Jestopher:
Thanks so much, Stephan.
Stephan Livera:
So I’ve been following what you guys are doing with Amboss and I thought it would be a good time to get you on and chat a little bit about Lightning Network just generally as well as maybe some tips out there for people who want to just get started and start running their own Lightning node and things like that.</description></item></channel></rss>
