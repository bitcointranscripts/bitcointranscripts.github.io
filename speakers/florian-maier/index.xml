TV: My name is Tone Vays. I come from the traditional Wall Street trading environment. I joined the crypto space in 2013. I spoke at my first conference and wrote my first article in Q1 2014. I was doing some trading. With the popularity of the youtube channel and going to conferences, I went back to trading options in traditional markets.</description></item></channel></rss>
