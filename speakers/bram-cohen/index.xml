Introduction I am going to talk about why cryptocurrencies matter. I am going to take the skeptics side. I am going to start from a banker&amp;rsquo;s standpoint why a lot of the things that cryptocurrency people land say don&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
Where are the engineers coming from? An engineer will look at something like Visa and say this is horrible. These are systems from 50-100 years ago.</description></item><item><title>Proofs Of Space</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/proofs-of-space/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/proofs-of-space/</guid><description>Beyond Hellman&amp;rsquo;s time-memory trade-offs with applications to proofs of space

Introductions Hi everyone. This presentation is based off of a paper called &amp;ldquo;Beyond Hellman&amp;rsquo;s time-memory trade-offs&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ll get to why it&amp;rsquo;s called that. These slides and the proofs are by Hamza Abusalah.
Outline I am going to describe what proofs of space are. I&amp;rsquo;ll give some previous constructions and information about them. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a simple new construction which has lots of advantages to it.</description></item><item><title>Merkle Set Data Structures for Scaling Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-07-08-bram-cohen-merkle-sets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-07-08-bram-cohen-merkle-sets/</guid><description>code: https://github.com/bramcohen/MerkleSet

Introduction There&amp;rsquo;s been a fair amount of talk about putting UTXO commitments in bitcoin blocks. Whether this is a good idea or not, but on the off-chance that it might be a good idea, I spent a fair amount of time thinking and actually good merkle set implementation whic his what you you need to put utxo set commitments in bitcoin blocks. There are other benefits to this, in that there are actually a million and one uses for merkle sets in general, and it&amp;rsquo;s actually a general interesting problem and it performs well.</description></item><item><title>How Wallets Can Handle Real Transaction Fees</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/transaction-fee-estimation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/transaction-fee-estimation/</guid><description>You should have a market at this point, where some number of transactions never happen because they aren&amp;rsquo;t willing to pay a fee. So you get some equilibrium of price going on. I proactively want to see this happen because we don&amp;rsquo;t know what fees should be until we run the experiment and see what prices end up being. For this to happen, wallets have to do price setting in some way.</description></item><item><title>Roundgroup Roundup 1</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/roundgroup-roundup-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/roundgroup-roundup-1/</guid><description>Roundtable roundup review 1
Future of SPV Technology So hopefully I summarized this reasonably. There were a number of things that came up in our discussion. It would help SPV a lot if there were UTXO commitments in blocks. This can be done with a soft-fork. It has implementation cost difficulties. There are some ugly things you could do about how the trees are formed, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to repopulate the whole thing every single block.</description></item></channel></rss>
