Introduction Thanks. I am the last talk of the session so I better make it interesting, and if not interesting then short at least. I am going to talk about proof-of-stake. This is collaboration with a few people. Vivek Bagaria, &amp;hellip; et al.
Proof-of-stake prism The starting point of this project was to come up with a proof-of-stake version of prism, which we just saw in the last talk. Prism has good latency and very high throughput and it also inherits the simplicity of the longest-chain protocol because its security is maintained by the longest chain protocol on each of the 1000 voting chains.</description></item><item><title>Solving The Blockchain Trilemma</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;
