Introduction Alright, thanks everyone for being here. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started. I am part of a project called Forte which wants to equip the game ecosystem with blockchain finance for their in-game economies. This is a unique set of constraints compared to what a lot of people are trying to build on blockchain today. We&amp;rsquo;re game experts. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely people more experts than us on the topics we&amp;rsquo;ll cover in this presentation, but what we want you to come away with is our best sense for the best path to get game economies running on blockchain.</description></item></channel></rss>
