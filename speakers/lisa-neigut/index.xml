Stephan Livera:
So guys, thanks for joining us. We’re talking about off-chain scaling. And so obviously Lightning is the first thing that comes to our mind, but maybe we could start with this idea of What is off-chain scaling? I think Lisa, you had something to add on this, didn’t you?
Matt Corallo:
We had a meeting in the back and we decided we were moving Lightning to TRON.</description></item><item><title>Liquidity Advertisements - niftynei - TABConf 2021</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/liquidity-advertisements-niftynei-tabconf-2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/liquidity-advertisements-niftynei-tabconf-2021/</guid><description>Introduction Again, my name is Lisa Neigut. I work at Blockstream. I&amp;rsquo;m here today to talk to you about the spec proposal that we&amp;rsquo;ve added to c-lightning and hoping to get into more Lightning implementation soon to make it standard. This is about liquidity advertisements. So today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking to you about what a liquidity ad is, how they work, kind of explain how data gets passed around Lightning Network just in general, and maybe get some of you excited about using them.</description></item><item><title>Dual Funded Channels</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/c-lightning/dual-funded-channels/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/c-lightning/dual-funded-channels/</guid><description>Dual Funding channels explainer + demo Cool. Okay, thanks everyone for coming. I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to go ahead and get started. It&amp;rsquo;s right at 11.02 on my time, so that hopefully more people will show up, but for everyone who&amp;rsquo;s here, I want to make the best use of all of your time. Okay, great. So for those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t really sure what dual funding is, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard people say that word before, but let me give you a kind of a quick overview.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Channel Accounting and Dual Funded Channels</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-04-24-lisa-neigut-lighting-network-channel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-04-24-lisa-neigut-lighting-network-channel/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/168/

Stephan Livera:
Lisa, welcome to the show.

Hi Stephan. Thanks for having me on.
Stephan Livera:
So Lisa, I saw you tweeted out about wanting to talk about lightning cryptographic primitives and some of the, obviously you’re working on a range of things, at Blockstream on the Elements project working on C-lightning and the lightning spec and stuff.</description></item><item><title>Ln Present And Future Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</guid><description>Lightning network present &amp;amp; future panel
LC: Can everyone hear me now? Alright, alright.
WO: It&amp;rsquo;s getting some good usage. A lot of those are businesses. Definitely it&amp;rsquo;s in the early stage. Elizabeth talked about this. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things that are mostly for fun, it&amp;rsquo;s not really at ecommerce yet.
LC: That&amp;rsquo;s for lnd?
WO: Sure, and I think Lisa can talk about c-lightning.
LC: I like these different implementations for LN.</description></item><item><title>Taxonomy Of Ln Nodes</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/taxonomy-of-ln-nodes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/taxonomy-of-ln-nodes/</guid><description>Introduction Hello. I work at Blockstream on c-lightning. I am here today to talk to you about a taxonomy of nodes about who&amp;rsquo;s who on the lightning network. I wnat ot go through the tools that have been built, looking through the perspectives of what different nodes are trying to accomplish.
LN map There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of nodes on the network. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some stats. There&amp;rsquo;s a little over 8,317 nodes.</description></item></channel></rss>
