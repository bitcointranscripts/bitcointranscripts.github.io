Bitcoin is unspent, but it requires two parties to sign. In order to spend it, you need two people to sign off on it. How do we make that happen? A multisig that two people sign off, so it&amp;rsquo;s 2 of 2 multisig.
We&amp;rsquo;re talking about lightning channels. A lightning channel is a UTXO that is locked up with a 2 of 2 (multisig).</description></item><item><title>Lightning Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/lightning-panel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022/lightning-panel/</guid><description>The discussion primarily revolved around the Lightning Network, a scaling solution for Bitcoin designed to enable faster, decentralized transactions. Rene Pickhardt and Lisa Neigut shared their insights, highlighting Lightning&amp;rsquo;s potential as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and a future payment infrastructure. They emphasized its efficiency for frequent transactions between trusted parties but noted challenges in its current infrastructure, such as the need for continuous online operation and the risk of losing funds if a node is compromised. The panelists discussed the scalability of the network, indicating that while millions could use it self-sovereignly, larger-scale adoption would likely involve centralized service providers. The conversation also touched on the impact of Taproot on privacy and channel efficiency, and the technical intricacies of maintaining state and preventing fraud within the network.</description></item><item><title>SLP324 Scaling Bitcoin off-chain with Matt Corallo, Alex Bosworth, Lisa Neigut, and Graham Krizek</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-11-27-lisa-neigut-alex-bosworth-graham-krizek-and-matt-corallo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-11-27-lisa-neigut-alex-bosworth-graham-krizek-and-matt-corallo/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/324/
Stephan Livera:
So guys, thanks for joining us. We’re talking about off-chain scaling. And so obviously Lightning is the first thing that comes to our mind, but maybe we could start with this idea of What is off-chain scaling? I think Lisa, you had something to add on this, didn’t you?
Matt Corallo:
We had a meeting in the back and we decided we were moving Lightning to TRON.</description></item><item><title>Liquidity Advertisements</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/liquidity-advertisements-niftynei-tabconf-2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/liquidity-advertisements-niftynei-tabconf-2021/</guid><description>Introduction Again, my name is Lisa Neigut. I work at Blockstream. I&amp;rsquo;m here today to talk to you about the spec proposal that we&amp;rsquo;ve added to c-lightning and hoping to get into more Lightning implementation soon to make it standard. This is about liquidity advertisements. So today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking to you about what a liquidity ad is, how they work, kind of explain how data gets passed around Lightning Network just in general, and maybe get some of you excited about using them.</description></item><item><title>Dual Funded Channels</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/dual-funded-channels/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/dual-funded-channels/</guid><description>Dual Funding channels explainer + demo Cool. Okay, thanks everyone for coming. I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to go ahead and get started. It&amp;rsquo;s right at 11.02 on my time, so that hopefully more people will show up, but for everyone who&amp;rsquo;s here, I want to make the best use of all of your time. Okay, great. So for those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t really sure what dual funding is, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard people say that word before, but let me give you a kind of a quick overview.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Channel Accounting and Dual Funded Channels</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-04-24-lisa-neigut-lighting-network-channel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-04-24-lisa-neigut-lighting-network-channel/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/168/
Lisa Neigut of Blockstream joins me to talk about Lightning Network Channels, c-lightning, and Dual Funded Channels.
Stephan Livera:
Lisa, welcome to the show.
Lisa Neigut:
Hi Stephan. Thanks for having me on.
Stephan Livera:
So Lisa, I saw you tweeted out about wanting to talk about lightning cryptographic primitives and some of the, obviously you’re working on a range of things, at Blockstream on the Elements project working on C-lightning and the lightning spec and stuff.</description></item><item><title>Taxonomy Of Ln Nodes</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/taxonomy-of-ln-nodes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/taxonomy-of-ln-nodes/</guid><description>Introduction Hello. I work at Blockstream on c-lightning. I am here today to talk to you about a taxonomy of nodes about who&amp;rsquo;s who on the lightning network. I wnat ot go through the tools that have been built, looking through the perspectives of what different nodes are trying to accomplish.
LN map There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of nodes on the network. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some stats. There&amp;rsquo;s a little over 8,317 nodes.</description></item><item><title>The Present and Future of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</guid><description>LC: Can everyone hear me now? Alright, alright.
WO: It&amp;rsquo;s getting some good usage. A lot of those are businesses. Definitely it&amp;rsquo;s in the early stage. Elizabeth talked about this. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things that are mostly for fun, it&amp;rsquo;s not really at ecommerce yet.
LC: That&amp;rsquo;s for lnd?
WO: Sure, and I think Lisa can talk about c-lightning.
LC: I like these different implementations for LN. Lisa, what about c-lightning development right now?</description></item><item><title>Unlocking Expressivity with OP_CAT</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-2024/unlocking-expressivity-with-op-cat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-2024/unlocking-expressivity-with-op-cat/</guid><description>Explore the exciting world of Bitcoin development with our panel discussion on OpCat, a proposed upgrade that could significantly enhance Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s functionality.
