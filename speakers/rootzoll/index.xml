Stephan Livera:
Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Stephan Livera podcast, a show about Bitcoin and Austrian economics today. My guests are Rootzoll and Openoms of the RaspiBlitz project. And if you’re interested in setting up your own Bitcoin node and running lightning and using Coinjoins with JoinMarket and so on, this is a great project to check out. So I’m really looking forward to my discussion with the guys today.</description></item><item><title>RaspiBlitz full node</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-hack-day/2020-06-21-rootzoll-openoms-raspiblitz/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-hack-day/2020-06-21-rootzoll-openoms-raspiblitz/</guid><description>Location: Potzblitz (online)
