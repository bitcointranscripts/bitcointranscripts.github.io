Stephan Livera:
NVK, welcome back.
NVK:
Hey man. Thanks for having me, dude. It’s been a while.
Stephan Livera:
Yeah, it has.
NVK:
I’m still winning on the amount of appearances consecutively.
Stephan Livera:
Yeah—actually I don’t know. I haven’t run that count actually. It’s been a while. But yeah, there’s so much going on with the world of Bitcoin, and obviously there’s always improvements going on in terms of hardware security, new technology coming, and how are we dealing and adapting with that, and how’s the software going to work with that hardware, and all of this.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Security &amp; Backups Primer</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-07-13-nvk-bitcoin-security/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-07-13-nvk-bitcoin-security/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/290/
Stephan Livera:
Mr. NVK. Welcome back to the show.
NVK:
Hey man. Thanks for having me.
Stephan Livera:
Yeah, dude, it’s been a while since we spoke about backups. So listeners, you might know we did an episode a little while back, but things change over time and we’ve got new listeners and new people coming in. So it was a good time. And I think there was a lot of support on Twitter for this idea of doing an episode specifically talking about how to do your backups.</description></item></channel></rss>
