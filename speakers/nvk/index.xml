As usual, nothing is happening in Bitcoin and we figured, what a great day to put people to sleep in a one to three hour podcast. We don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. We actually don&amp;rsquo;t know how this is going to play out at all. I have here with me Mr. Rijndael. Hello, sir. Welcome back.
Rijndael: 00:01:30
Hello. Good morning.
NVK: 00:01:32
Good morning.</description></item><item><title>Libsec Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/libsec-panel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/libsec-panel/</guid><description>Intros NVK: I have an absolute rock star team here. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I start introducing the panel? Tim, hello! Do you want to tell a very brief what do you do?
Tim: Yes, so my name is Tim Ruffing. I am a maintainer of the libsecp256k1 library. I do work for Blockstream, who pay me to do this and also who pay me to do research on cryptography and all kinds of aspects related to Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>#MPCbros vs #TeamScript Debate</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/mpcbros-vs-teamscript-debate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/mpcbros-vs-teamscript-debate/</guid><description>In this episode of the Bitcoin Review, NVK moderates a debate between Rijndael and Rob Hamilton, representing Team MPC and Team Script respectively. The discussion explores the merits and challenges of multi-party computation (MPC) and Bitcoin Script in enhancing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s functionality and security. Rijndael explains MPC&amp;rsquo;s ability to create shared key pairs and more efficient multi-signature transactions using Schnorr signatures and Taproot, improving privacy and space efficiency. Rob counters with Script’s simplicity, auditability, and established history in Bitcoin, highlighting the transparency of on-chain scripts. The debate covers various technical aspects including signature aggregation, nonce management, and the potential for covenants and transaction introspection to enhance Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s programmability. Both sides acknowledge the importance of advancing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s scripting capabilities while ensuring security and usability. The episode concludes with insights on the future of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s technical development, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to drive adoption and enhance user experience</description></item><item><title>Lightning Privacy &amp; Splice Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/lightning-privacy-splice-panel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/lightning-privacy-splice-panel/</guid><description>Housekeeping Speaker 0: 00:01:17
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about Lightning privacy, splicing and other very cool things with an absolute amazing panel here. Just before that, I have a couple of things that I want to set out some updates. So OpenSats is now taking grants for a Bitcoin application, sorry, taking grant applications for Bitcoin projects and Nostra projects and Lightning projects. And there is about five mil for an OSTER, five mil for Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>OP_VAULT Round 2 &amp; OP_CTV</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</guid><description>The podcast episode discusses the OP_VAULT proposal for enhancing Bitcoin self-custody and security. NVK hosts a panel with James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne, Rijndael, Greg Sanders, and Ben Carman, who delve into the technical aspects and benefits of OP_VAULT. The proposal aims to improve Bitcoin custody by introducing vaults, allowing users to lock their coins with predetermined spend conditions, enhancing security against theft and accidental loss. They compare OP_VAULT with other proposals like CTV and ANYPREVOUT, highlighting its simplicity and operational efficiency. The conversation also addresses potential concerns about covenants and the importance of community engagement and education to facilitate the proposal&amp;rsquo;s acceptance and activation. The episode emphasizes the need for better custody solutions to secure large amounts of Bitcoin, especially as the user base grows and the value of Bitcoin increases.</description></item><item><title>OP_VAULT for Bitcoin Covenants Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-for-bitcoin-covenants-panel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-for-bitcoin-covenants-panel/</guid><description>Speaker 0: 00:00:45
Today we have an absolute all-star panel here. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about the Bitcoin Op Vault. It&amp;rsquo;s a new proposal by James. And you know, like any new proposals to Bitcoin, there is a lot to go over. And It&amp;rsquo;s a very big, interesting topic. So today we have Rindell.
Speaker 2: 00:01:05
Hey, good morning. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m here talking about vaults, Bitcoin developer, and I work a lot on multi-sig and vaults that don&amp;rsquo;t use covenants.</description></item><item><title>Coldcard Mk4, Tapsigner, Satscard – Bitcoin Hardware Innovation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2022-01-31-nvk-bitcoin-hardware-innovation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2022-01-31-nvk-bitcoin-hardware-innovation/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/344/
Stephan Livera:
NVK, welcome back.
NVK:
Hey man. Thanks for having me, dude. It’s been a while.
Stephan Livera:
Yeah, it has.
NVK:
I’m still winning on the amount of appearances consecutively.
Stephan Livera:
Yeah—actually I don’t know. I haven’t run that count actually. It’s been a while. But yeah, there’s so much going on with the world of Bitcoin, and obviously there’s always improvements going on in terms of hardware security, new technology coming, and how are we dealing and adapting with that, and how’s the software going to work with that hardware, and all of this.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Security &amp; Backups Primer</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-07-13-nvk-bitcoin-security/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-07-13-nvk-bitcoin-security/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/290/
Stephan Livera:
Mr. NVK. Welcome back to the show.
NVK:
Hey man. Thanks for having me.
Stephan Livera:
Yeah, dude, it’s been a while since we spoke about backups. So listeners, you might know we did an episode a little while back, but things change over time and we’ve got new listeners and new people coming in. So it was a good time. And I think there was a lot of support on Twitter for this idea of doing an episode specifically talking about how to do your backups.</description></item></channel></rss>
