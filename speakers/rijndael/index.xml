As usual, nothing is happening in Bitcoin and we figured, what a great day to put people to sleep in a one to three hour podcast. We don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. We actually don&amp;rsquo;t know how this is going to play out at all. I have here with me Mr. Rijndael. Hello, sir. Welcome back.
Rijndael: 00:01:30
Hello. Good morning.
NVK: 00:01:32
Good morning.</description></item><item><title>Libsec Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/libsec-panel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/libsec-panel/</guid><description>Intros NVK: I have an absolute rock star team here. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I start introducing the panel? Tim, hello! Do you want to tell a very brief what do you do?
Tim: Yes, so my name is Tim Ruffing. I am a maintainer of the libsecp256k1 library.

The discussion explores the merits and challenges of multi-party computation (MPC) and Bitcoin Script in enhancing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s functionality and security. Rijndael explains MPC&amp;rsquo;s ability to create shared key pairs and more efficient multi-signature transactions using Schnorr signatures and Taproot, improving privacy and space efficiency. Rob counters with Script’s simplicity, auditability, and established history in Bitcoin, highlighting the transparency of on-chain scripts. The debate covers various technical aspects including signature aggregation, nonce management, and the potential for covenants and transaction introspection to enhance Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s programmability. Both sides acknowledge the importance of advancing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s scripting capabilities while ensuring security and usability. The episode concludes with insights on the future of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s technical development, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to drive adoption and enhance user experience</description></item><item><title>OP_VAULT Round 2 &amp; OP_CTV</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</guid><description>The podcast episode discusses the OP_VAULT proposal for enhancing Bitcoin self-custody and security. NVK hosts a panel with James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne, Rijndael, Greg Sanders, and Ben Carman, who delve into the technical aspects and benefits of OP_VAULT. The proposal aims to improve Bitcoin custody by introducing vaults, allowing users to lock their coins with predetermined spend conditions, enhancing security against theft and accidental loss. They compare OP_VAULT with other proposals like CTV and ANYPREVOUT, highlighting its simplicity and operational efficiency. The conversation also addresses potential concerns about covenants and the importance of community engagement and education to facilitate the proposal&amp;rsquo;s acceptance and activation. The episode emphasizes the need for better custody solutions to secure large amounts of Bitcoin, especially as the user base grows and the value of Bitcoin increases.</description></item><item><title>Cashu &amp; Fedimint: ecash, Bitcoin's layer 3 &amp; scalability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/cashu-and-fedimint/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/cashu-and-fedimint/</guid><description>Introduction If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had your brain completely destroyed by the segregated witness episode, I hope that the e-cash episode will finalize.
