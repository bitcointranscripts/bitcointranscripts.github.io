As usual, nothing is happening in Bitcoin and we figured, what a great day to put people to sleep in a one to three hour podcast. We don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. We actually don&amp;rsquo;t know how this is going to play out at all. I have here with me Mr. Rijndael. Hello, sir. Welcome back.
Rijndael: 00:01:30
Hello. Good morning.
NVK: 00:01:32

Hello and welcome back to the Bitcoin.review. Today we have a very interesting show. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a knife fight. Two men go into a room with one knife. One comes out. On my left side, Rindell for team MPC, weighing 64 kilobytes. On my right side, Rob for team script with variable sizing, so we don&amp;rsquo;t know. Is this already a loss? We don&amp;rsquo;t know, let&amp;rsquo;s find out.</description></item><item><title>OP_VAULT Round 2 &amp; OP_CTV</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-review-podcast/op_vault-round-2-op_ctv/</guid><description>Introductions Speaker 0: 00:01:25
Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to get back to OBVault, just kidding, UpVault, this new awesome proposal on how we can make people&amp;rsquo;s money safe in the future.
