Introduction It always seems like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of different proof systems, but it turns out they really work well together and there&amp;rsquo;s great abstractions that are happening where we can take different tools and plug them together. We will see some of those in this session. I think STARKs were first announced 3 years ago back when this conference was BPASE, and now they are ready to use for developers and they are deployed in the wild and it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to see how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come in the past few years.</description></item><item><title>The STARK truth about DEXes</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/stark-dex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/stark-dex/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090731793395798016
Welcome to the first session after lunch. We call this the post-lunch session. The first part is on STARKs by Eli Ben-Sasson.
Introduction Thank you very much. Today I will be talking about STARK proofs of DEXes. I am chief scientist at Starkware. We&amp;rsquo;re a one-year startup in Israel that has raised $40m and we have a grant from the Ethereum Foundation. We have 20 team members. Most of them are engineers.</description></item></channel></rss>
