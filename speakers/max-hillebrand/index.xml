Stephan Livera:
Max, great to chat again.
Max Hillebrand:
Oh, welcome, Stephan. I’m really looking forward to this conversation. It’s gonna be a fun one.
Stephan Livera:
Right. So look, as I’ve mentioned, I think we’re gonna disagree a bit on this one, but let’s chat it out. Let’s discuss what’s going on in the world of Bitcoin and privacy. So obviously the main topic here is going to be around what’s going on with Wasabi Wallet and the blacklisting, but if you wanted to just give us your thoughts on how we got to this situation, or maybe just provide a bit of an overview about what’s going on for listeners who aren’t familiar and then we can discuss the various issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
