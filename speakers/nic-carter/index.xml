I am going to be talking about bitcoin as an economic system, not as a software or cryptographic system. This talk has two parts. In the first, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a retrospective of the past 10 years of bitcoin as a functioning economic system. In the second part, I will be looking at bitcoin as it is today and how it will be in the future.</description></item><item><title>Investing In Bitcoin Businesses</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/investing-in-bitcoin-businesses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/investing-in-bitcoin-businesses/</guid><description>1 on 1: Investing in bitcoin businesses

MM: I run a podcast based here in Latvia on bitcoin economics and money. It&amp;rsquo;s American-Latvian. I do it with my partner who is based in Brazil. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on investing in businesses focused on bitcoin and crypto.
NC: My name is Nic Carter. I work for a venture fund. We&amp;rsquo;re one of the few venture funds that focus on bitcoin and bitcoin-related startups.</description></item></channel></rss>
