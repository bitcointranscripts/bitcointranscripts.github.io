They explain that DLCs can enable various applications such as betting, options contracts, insurance, and synthetic assets. They highlight the advantages of DLCs, including high liquidity and fast trading of futures, especially once implemented on the Lightning Network. However, they also acknowledge that there may still be a need for centralized solutions depending on the specific use case. The speakers delve into the technical aspects of DLCs, including the transition to Schnorr signatures and the privacy implications of using DLCs. They also discuss the role of oracles in DLCs and the potential for coin joints with DLCs. Overall, the speakers provide a detailed overview of DLCs and their potential applications in the cryptocurrency space.</description></item><item><title>What You Should Know About Bitcoin DLCs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-10-15-nadav-kohen-bitcoin-dlcs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-10-15-nadav-kohen-bitcoin-dlcs/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/219/
Stephan Livera:
Nadav welcome to the show.
Nadav Kohen:
Thanks for having me.
Stephan Livera:
Nadav I’ve been following your work for a little while. Obviously I really I like reading your blog posts over at Suredbits, and I had the chance to meet you earlier this year in London. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what’s your role with Suredbits?
Nadav Kohen:
Yeah. so I am a software engineer at Suredbits.</description></item><item><title>Payment Points</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/payment-points/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/payment-points/</guid><description>Nadav Kohen: 00:00:00
Right now in the Lightning Network, if I were to make a payment every single hop along that route, they would know that they&amp;rsquo;re on the same route, because every single HTLC uses the same hash. It&amp;rsquo;s a bad privacy leak. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a much worse privacy leak now that we have multi-path payments, because every single path along your multi-path payment uses the same hash as well.</description></item><item><title>Replacing Payment Hashes with Payment Points</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-nadav-kohen-payment-points/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-nadav-kohen-payment-points/</guid><description>Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15l4h2_zEY4zXC6n1NqsImcjgA0fovl_lkgkKu1O3QT0/

Intro My name is Nadav Kohen. I’m a software engineer at Suredbits. I’m going to talk about payment points which have been alluded to throughout the conference by various talks.
Hash Timelocked Contract (HTLC) Routing First of all, some preliminaries, HTLCs. I don’t think I’m going to spend much time on this slide. We all know what they are. For every hop forward you add a hash timelocked contract.</description></item></channel></rss>
