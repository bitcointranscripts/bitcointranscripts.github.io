All right. Welcome, everybody. This is the Learning Bitcoin and Design Call. It&amp;rsquo;s July 26, 2022. And our topic this week is FediMint. And we have Justin Moon here with us and several designers and product folks in the room here that are interested in learning about this. So I&amp;rsquo;ve got a FigJam open here where we can toss images, ideas, text, links, whatever we want to consolidate during the call.</description></item><item><title>Q A</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/q-a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/q-a/</guid><description>Q&amp;amp;A session

MB: I have a podcast called Tales from the Crypt where I interview people working on and around bitcoin. I have spoken to many of these gentlemen on the podcast as well. I want to focus on, many of these presentations were focused on history and prehistory of bitcoin. For this Q&amp;amp;A session, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the future of the bitcoin standard. Michael, I want you to talk about the future of the bitcoin standard on a sound money point standpoint, like not having to chase for a store of value like houses.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Developers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-developers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-developers/</guid><description>Introduction I am going to talk about a programmer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. As investors, you might find this interesting, but at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely actionable. As a programmer, the bitcoin ecosystem is very attractive.

Introduction I am going to be talking about the state of multisig. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of creating a transaction output that requires multiple keys to sign. This is a focus for people holding bitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about some of the benefits and some of the issues. I am not a security expert, though.
Perspective Multisig is an emphasis on saving and not spending a lot.</description></item></channel></rss>
