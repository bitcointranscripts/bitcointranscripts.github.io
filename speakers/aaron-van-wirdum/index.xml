Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:24
Hey, Sjors, we&amp;rsquo;re back. We&amp;rsquo;re back in beautiful, sunny Utrecht after I spent some time in Miami and Prague. You spent some time in Prague, and more Prague, is that right?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:38
Mostly Prague.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:38
You were in Prague for a while. That&amp;rsquo;s where we recorded the previous episode about Stratum V2.</description></item><item><title>Inscriptions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/inscriptions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/inscriptions/</guid><description>Introduction Aaron Van Wirdum: 00:00:20
Live from Utrecht, this is Bitcoin Explained. Sjors, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna lean into some Twitter controversy today.
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:27
Exactly, we have to jump on the bandwagon and make sure that we talk about what other people talk about.
Aaron Van Wirdum: 00:00:34
Love it! Yeah, actually I got this request from a colleague of mine, Brandon Green, and since I am his humble servant, I had no other choice but to make an episode about this topic, which is inscriptions, and maybe also ordinals to some extent but yeah as you mentioned everyone&amp;rsquo;s talking about it now which I think for both of us was more of a demotivating factor because everything that&amp;rsquo;s that can be said about it has been said by now maybe.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core v24 Bug</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v24-bug/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v24-bug/</guid><description>Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:20

Live from Utrecht, this is Bitcoin Explained. Sjors, are we still making a bi-weekly podcast?
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:28
I mean, it depends on what you mean by bi. It&amp;rsquo;s more like a feeling, right?
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:32
We make a podcast when we feel about it these days. Is that the rule?

No, it&amp;rsquo;s also when we&amp;rsquo;re not traveling or sick or whatever.</description></item><item><title>Security Issue: Burying Bitcoin Soft Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/security-issue-burying-bitcoin-soft-forks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/security-issue-burying-bitcoin-soft-forks/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this episode of Bitcoin, Explained, hosts Aaron van Wirdum and Sjors Provoost revisit the Taproot activation saga, this time to discuss burying of soft forks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taproot, the last soft fork to have been deployed on the Bitcoin network, activated in late 2021. Now, Bitcoin Core developers are considering to &amp;lsquo;bury&amp;rsquo; the soft fork, which means that future Bitcoin Core releases will treat Taproot as if the rule change has been active since Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s very beginning. (With the exception of one block mined in 2021 that breached the Taproot rules which have since been added to the protocol.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the episode, Sjors explains what the benefits are of burying a soft fork, in particular pointing out how it helps developers when they review the Bitcoin Core codebase or when they perform tests on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, Aaron and Sjors outline a potential edge case scenario where burying soft forks could, in a worst-case scenario, split the Bitcoin blockchain between upgraded and non-upgraded nodes. Bitcoin Core developers generally don&amp;rsquo;t consider this edge case - a very long block re-org - to be a realistic problem and/or believe that this would be such a big problem that a buried soft fork would be a minor concern comparatively. However, they explain, not everyone agrees with this assessment entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Aaron and Sjors touch on issues like whether soft fork activation logic should itself be considered a soft fork, and whether soft fork burying logic should be considered a consensus change and/or require a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Death to the Mempool, Long Live The Mempool</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/death-to-the-mempool-long-live-the-mempool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/death-to-the-mempool-long-live-the-mempool/</guid><description>Preamble Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:20

Welcome to Bitcoin Explained, the podcast with the most boring name in Bitcoin. Hey Sjors.
Sjors: 00:00:27
What&amp;rsquo;s up? What&amp;rsquo;s with the new name?
Aaron: 00:00:29
So We&amp;rsquo;ve rebranded our podcast. What do you think?
Sjors: 00:00:33
Well, I think, you know, especially if you read it correctly, Bitcoin, explained. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing name.

&lt;p>Where coins on Bitcoin’s base layer are sent to addresses, the Lightning network uses invoices. Invoices communicate the requested amount, node destination, and the hash of a secret which is used for payment routing. This works, but has a number of limitations, Sjors explains, notably that the amount must be bitcoin-denominated (as opposed for fiat denominated), and the invoice can only be used once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BOLT 12, which has been implemented in c-ligtning, is a way to essentially refer a payer to the node that is to be paid, in order to request a new invoice. While the BOLT 12 offer can be static and reusable — it always refers to the same node — the payee can generate new invoices on the fly when requested, allowing for much more flexibility, Sjors explains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Aaron and Sjors discuss how the new BOLT 12 messages are communicated over the Lightning Network through an update to the BOLT 7 specification for message relay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replace-by-Fee Bug (CVE-2021-31876)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/replace-by-fee-bug/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/replace-by-fee-bug/</guid><description>Intro Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:08

Aaron and Sjors explain three advantages of RBF: the option the “speed up” a transaction (1), which can in turn result in a more effective fee market for block space (2), as well as the potential to make more efficient use of block space by updating transactions to include more recipients (3). The main disadvantage of RBF is that it makes it slightly easier to double spend unconfirmed transactions, which was also at the root of last week’s “double spend” controversy that dominated headlines. Aaron and Sjors discuss some solutions to diminish this risk, including “opt-in RBF” which is currently implemented in Bitcoin Core. Finally, Sjors explains in detail how opt-in RBF works in Bitcoin Core, and which conditions must be met before a transaction is considered replaceable. He also notes some complications with this version of RBF, for example in the context of the Lightning Network.</description></item><item><title>Compact Client Side Filtering: Neutrino</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/compact-client-side-filtering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/compact-client-side-filtering/</guid><description>Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:01:34

So it&amp;rsquo;s fun that the market cap goes up, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter unless you&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Open Timestamps: Leveraging Bitcoin's Security For All Data</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/open-timestamps-leveraging-bitcoin-s-security-for-all-data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/open-timestamps-leveraging-bitcoin-s-security-for-all-data/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this episode of The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado, Aaron and Sjors discuss Open Timestamps, a Bitcoin-based time stamping project from applied cryptography consultant and former Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd. Open Timestamps leverages the security of the Bitcoin blockchain to timestamp any type of data, allowing for irrefutable proof that that data existed at a particular point in time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aaron and Sjors explain that virtually any amount of data can, in fact, be timestamped in the Bitcoin blockchain at minimal cost because Open Timestamps leverages Merkle trees, the cryptographic trick to aggregate data into a single, compact hash. This hash is then included in a Bitcoin transaction, making all of the data aggregated into the hash as immutable as any other Bitcoin transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Todd offered an interesting showcase of Open Timestamps earlier this week, as he proved that the public key used by Google to sign “the email&amp;quot; to Hunter Biden indeed existed in 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aaron and Sjors also discuss some of the other possibilities that a time-stamping system like Open Timestamps offers, as well as its limitations. Finally, Aaron provides a little bit of context for the history of cryptographic time stamping, which was itself referenced in the Bitcoin white paper&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core 0.21 Supports Tor V3</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v21-supports-tor-v3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-explained/bitcoin-core-v21-supports-tor-v3/</guid><description>Introduction Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:07
Live from Utrecht, this is the Van Wirdum Sjorsnado. Sjors, you pointed out to me that Bitcoin Core has an amazing new feature merged into its repository.
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:19
Absolutely, we have bigger onions now.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:24
Right, so I had basically no idea what it meant. You figured it out.
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:29
I did.
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:34
Yeah so let&amp;rsquo;s start at the beginning.</description></item><item><title>Accounts for Bitcoin, Easypaysy!</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-explained/accounts-for-bitcoin-easypaysy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/bitcoin-explained/accounts-for-bitcoin-easypaysy/</guid><description>Intro Aaron: 00:01:10
Sjors how do you like reusing addresses?
Sjors: 00:01:13
I love reusing addresses, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
Aaron: 00:01:16
It&amp;rsquo;s so convenient isn&amp;rsquo;t it
Sjors: 00:01:18
It just makes you feel like you know your exchange if you&amp;rsquo;re sending them money they know everything about you and they like that right?
Aaron: 00:01:26
It&amp;rsquo;s so convenient, it&amp;rsquo;s so easy, nothing to complain about here.
Sjors: 00:01:30
Absolutely.

Live from Utrecht, this is the Van Wirdum Sjorsnedo. Hello! Sjors, welcome.
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:12
Thank you. It&amp;rsquo;s good to be back. Well, I never left, but&amp;hellip;
Aaron van Wirdum: 00:00:15
Yeah, well, we&amp;rsquo;re at your home now, so you never left, I think. You probably literally never left because of corona
Sjors Provoost: 00:00:21
Exactly we&amp;rsquo;re at my secret location
