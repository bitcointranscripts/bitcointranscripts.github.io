Slides: https://lightningresidency.com/assets/presentations/Ou_Bootstrapping_and_Maintaining_a_Lightning_Node.pdf
Intro My name ie Elaine. I’ll talk about bootstrapping and maintaining a lightning node. Pretty much all of you have probably already set up a node so this should all be review. You guys will probably know more about this than I do.
Bootstrapping and Maintaining a Lightning Node We’ll start with an overview of how routing works just to understand what the nodes are trying to do and from there we’ll step back and look at ways of finding peers and getting incoming channels and maintaining capacity.</description></item><item><title>Weak-Signal Radio Communications For Bitcoin Network Resilience</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/weak-signal-radio-communications-for-bitcoin-network-resilience/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/weak-signal-radio-communications-for-bitcoin-network-resilience/</guid><description>What is weak-signal HF radio? These are called high frequency. That&amp;rsquo;s the official name for these frequencies. Short wave is for historical reasons is longer waves and much higher frequency compared to our wireless internet frequencies. The terminology is backwards. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the ionosphere and how we&amp;rsquo;re bouncing signals off of it. This is really long-range stuff. This is an old Voice of America broadcast station that broadcasted radio programs across the pacific.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Without Internet</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/bitcoin-without-internet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/bitcoin-without-internet/</guid><description>SM: We have a special announcement to make. Let me kick it over to Richard right now.
RM: We completed a project that will integrate the GoTenna mesh radio system with Blockstream&amp;rsquo;s blocksat satellite system. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty exciting. It&amp;rsquo;s called txtenna. It will allow anybody to send a signed bitcoin transaction from an off-grid full node that is receiving blockchain data from the blocksat network, and then relay it over the GoTenna mesh network.</description></item></channel></rss>
