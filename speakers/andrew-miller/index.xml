Any website that is better than someone saying &amp;ldquo;you know, check the June July 2014 bitcoin-wizard logs&amp;rdquo;. We need to research gmaxwell scalability. We should probably fix that.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what some of the goals are that we might get out of this. We have some different ideas for approaches to systematizing knowledge. There are at least three camps here. I think Bryan&amp;rsquo;s paper repositories.</description></item><item><title>Coinscope</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/coinscope-andrew-miller/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/coinscope-andrew-miller/</guid><description>http://cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/
I am going to talk about a pair of tools, one is a simulator and another one is a measurement station for the bitcoin network. So let me start with the bitcoin simulator framework. The easiest approach is to create a customized model that is a simplified abstraction of what you care about- which is like simbit, to show off how selfish-mining works. What you put in is what you get, so the model is actually different from the actual behavior of the bitcoin network means that you don&amp;rsquo;t learn anything really.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/introduction/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;

PCP-based SNARKs can use random oracle assumption instantiated by hash function, sha256 acts as the random oracle.</description></item><item><title>Step by Step Towards Writing a Safe Contract: Insights from an Undergraduate Ethereum Lab</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/andrew-miller/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/andrew-miller/</guid><description>Next up I want to introduce Elaine Shi and Andrew Miller from University of Maryland. Andrew is also on the zerocash team.
Okay. I am an assistant professor at the University of Maryland. We all believe that cryptocurrency is the way of the future and smart contracts. So students in the future have to program smart contracts.
So that&amp;rsquo;s what I did. I asked some students to program some smart contracts.</description></item></channel></rss>
