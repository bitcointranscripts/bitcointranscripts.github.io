Introduction There are two parts to this talk. The first part of the talk will be building, like all the pieces we put into making the implementation of bulletproofs. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the group we used, the Ristretto group and ristretto255 group. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about parallel lelliptic curve arithmetic, and Merlin transcripts for zero-knowledge proofs, and how all these pieces fit together.
Cathie will talk in part two about constraint system proofs, cloak for a confidential assets protocol, ZkVM for zero-knowledge contracts, and aggregation multi-party computation with session types to aggregate proofs and have faster verification.</description></item></channel></rss>
