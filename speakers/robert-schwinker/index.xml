Hackathon intro&amp;mdash; Thank you everyone for showing up. This is a fantastic event coming togehter. Mid-February we were focusing on our team, how were we going to make the room feel full at 800 people? Well today we are sold-out at 1500 people. We have a full room today and we are excited about the developers that have come together. It is the perfect day for a Hackathon, it&amp;rsquo;s rizzling 50 degrees if you choose to go outside so we will have a captive auience.</description></item></channel></rss>
