Stephan Livera: Jan, welcome to the show.
Jan Čapek: Hi, thanks for having me here.
Stephan Livera: So Jan I had the pleasure of meeting you at Riga for Baltic Honeybadger and I know you’ve been doing a lot of work on Stratum, the second version of the protocol. First I wanted to get a bit of background from you, how did you get involved with all of this and working as one of the CEOs of Braiins and Slush Pool?</description></item></channel></rss>
