Stephan Livera: Jan, welcome to the show.
Jan Čapek: Hi, thanks for having me here.
Stephan Livera: So Jan I had the pleasure of meeting you at Riga for Baltic Honeybadger and I know you’ve been doing a lot of work on Stratum, the second version of the protocol.

cgminer cgminer used to be a CPU miner that has been functionally removed a long time ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
