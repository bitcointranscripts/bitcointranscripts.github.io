Hi everybody, I&amp;rsquo;m Shinobi from Bitcoin Magazine and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting down here with Christian Jecker from Blockstream.
Speaker 1: 00:00:07
I am.
Speaker 0: 00:00:08
So Rusty dropped an atom bomb yesterday with his proposal to turn all the things back on just with the kind of VerOps budget analogous to the SigOps budget to kind of rein in the denial of service risks as just a path forward given that everybody&amp;rsquo;s spent the last few years fighting over their narrow little change they want to get in.</description></item><item><title>Deploying Lightning at Scale (Greenlight)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-christian-decker-greenlight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2022/2022-03-03-christian-decker-greenlight/</guid><description>Blog post on Greenlight: https://blog.blockstream.com/en-greenlight-by-blockstream-lightning-made-easy/

Intro Jeff Gallas: Next up is Christian Decker. He is a Lightning developer at Blockstream. He has got a very simple title. It is Security, Simplicity and DevOps: the trade-offs between a Lightning PPAS and running your own node. That is already half of the talk.
Christian Decker: Thank you very much, I’m Chris and for once I am not going to shill eltoo, I promise.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2022-03-01-lightning-panel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2022-03-01-lightning-panel/</guid><description>Topic: The Lightning Network in 2022

Wanted to chat with you about a bunch of stuff that you’ve been doing. We’ve got a couple of things that I was really interested to chat with you about ANYPREVOUT, MPP, lightning attacks. What’s the latest with lightning network. But yeah, let’s start with a little bit around ANYPREVOUT. So I see that yourself and AJ towns just recently did an update and I think AJ Towns just did an email to the mailing list saying, okay, here’s the update to ANYPREVOUT, do you want to just give us a little bit of background?</description></item><item><title>Lightning Backups</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-hack-day/2020-05-03-christian-decker-lightning-backups/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-hack-day/2020-05-03-christian-decker-lightning-backups/</guid><description>Topic: Back the f*** up
Location: Potzblitz (online)
Intro (Jeff Gallas) We’re live. Welcome to the fourth episode of Potzblitz, the weekly Lightning talk. Today we have a very special guest, Christian Decker of Blockstream. They also call him Dr Bitcoin. Our co-host today is Michael Folkson from the London BitDevs meetup. He is doing a bunch of Socratic Seminars and has a deep technical knowledge. He will be the perfect person to speak to Christian and has already prepared a bunch of questions.</description></item><item><title>C-Lightning Questions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-09-04-christian-decker-c-lightning-questions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-09-04-christian-decker-c-lightning-questions/</guid><description>c-lightning Q and A session
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230527903969841152
Introduction Hello everyone. I’m Christian. I’m a software developer at Blockstream and I work on Lightning, both the specification and the implementation. Today we are going to have a shortish webinar on how to get started with Lightning.
Q and A Q - Is it possible to run c-lightning and lnd on the same host in parallel?
A - It absolutely is. We actually do that on a regular basis to test compatibility between the implementations.</description></item><item><title>Multiparty Channels (Lightning Network)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-multiparty-channels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-multiparty-channels/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019

Symmetric Update Protocols eltoo Update Mechanism Two days ago, we’ve seen the symmetric update mechanism called eltoo, and having a symmetric update mechanism has some really nice properties that enable some really cool stuff. Just to remind everybody, this is what eltoo looks like. That’s the one you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. It’s not the only symmetric update mechanism, though.
Duplex Micropayment Channels It was predated by this stuff.</description></item><item><title>Rendezvous Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-rendezvous-routing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-rendezvous-routing/</guid><description>Rendezvous Routing (Lightning Network)

Transcript by: Caralie Chrisco and Davius Parvin
Introduction Okay, the second part is rendezvous routing. I basically already gave away the trick but I hope you all forgot. So what is rendezvous routing? Anybody have a good explanation of what we are trying to do here? So we have someplace where we meet in the middle, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to know where you live, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know where I live, we&amp;rsquo;re all really private.</description></item><item><title>Eltoo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</guid><description>Eltoo: The (Far) Future of Lightning

Intro Who has never heard about eltoo? It is my pet project and I am pretty proud of it. I will try to keep this short. I was told that you all have seen my presentation about the evolution of update protocols. I will probably go pretty quickly. I still want to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions if they have any.</description></item><item><title>Onion Routing Deep Dive</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Residency – Summer 2019
Intro We&amp;rsquo;ve not seen exactly why we are using an onion, or why we chose this construction of an onion and how this construction of an onion actually looks like. So my goal right now is to basically walk you through the iterations that onion routing packets have done so far, and why we chose this construction we have here.
So, just to be funny, I have once again the difference between distance vector routing, which is IP-based routing, basically, where we just have the recipient’s address, and source-based routing, where we have a list of intermediates, in which we can then finally reach our destination.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Channel Factories</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-14-christian-decker-channel-factories/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-03-14-christian-decker-channel-factories/</guid><description>Lightning topology limitation Stephan: Christian, welcome to the show.

Intro Good morning from the last day of presentations. I’m Chris still. Today I will be talking to you about c-lightning, how to develop on it, how to extend it, adapt it to your needs and how to customize it so it fits into whatever you are trying to do. Not whatever we thought you might want to do.
Goals First of all the goals of c-lightning are basically to be fast and lightweight.</description></item><item><title>History of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018
Introduction Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Chris, as I said like three times before, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about the history of Lightning and history of off-chain protocols or layer two, or you name it, whatever name you want. I like to call them off chain because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply a hierarchy of layers but I&amp;rsquo;ll use all three terms interchangeably anyway.
I like to have an interactive presentation so if you have any questions please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate, just ask.</description></item><item><title>Lightning ≈ Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-lightning-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-lightning-bitcoin/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018
Introduction Good morning everyone my name is Chris and I&amp;rsquo;m a bitcoiners anonymous. So my job today is basically to tell you why Lightning is Bitcoin and why it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly Bitcoin. So there&amp;rsquo;s a few fundamental differences between Bitcoin on-chain payments and Lightning. I will always call Bitcoin on-chain payments just because it&amp;rsquo;s sort of the classical way of doing it.
The differences between Bitcoin and Lightning are sometimes small, sometimes bigger.</description></item></channel></rss>
