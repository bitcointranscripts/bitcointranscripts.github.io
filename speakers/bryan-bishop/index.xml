I&amp;rsquo;ll be the contrarian - I think academia is awful and should be destroyed.
Reputation is completely independent of content and should not be the mechanism by which you judge the quality of research; your reputation is worthless to me. (laughter)
My perspective: [first, slidemaker&amp;rsquo;s regret! might have reorganized this] I&amp;rsquo;m a bitcoin core developer. Also worked at LedgerX (4 years). I also work on biotech on the hobbyist side, garage engineering &amp;ndash; what I was doing when bitcoin was launched.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Vaults and Custody</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-09-22-bryan-bishop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2019-09-22-bryan-bishop/</guid><description>Stephan Livera Podcast with Bryan Bishop - September 22nd 2019

Stephan Livera: Bryan, welcome to the show, man. I’m a big fan of your work.
Bryan Bishop: Thank you. I’m a big fan of yours as well.
Stephan Livera: Yeah, so look, we’re doing Bitcoin Custody. I know you’re one of the guys to talk to on this exact topic. And so, maybe we’ll just start with a little bit of a background.</description></item><item><title>Block Reorgs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/what-bitcoin-did-podcast/2019-05-14-adam-back-bryan-bishop-block-reorgs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/what-bitcoin-did-podcast/2019-05-14-adam-back-bryan-bishop-block-reorgs/</guid><description>Topic: Bitcoin Block Re-orgs

Adam Back (AB): Good!
PM: How you doing Bryan?
Bryan Bishop (BB): Doing good!
PM: So we&amp;rsquo;re here to talk about re-orgs. Something I&amp;rsquo;d heard about before because didn&amp;rsquo;t the BSV chain have a couple of re-orgs recently?</description></item><item><title>Handling Reorgs &amp; Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/reorgs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/reorgs/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1052344700554960896
Introduction Good morning, my name is Bryan. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about reorganizations and forks in the bitcoin blockchain. First, I want to define what a reorganization is and what a fork is.
Definitions You might have heard that the bitcoin blockchain is a permanent data structure that records everything from all time and that is actually somewhat false. Instead, actually the bitcoin blockchain can be modified and changed, and some of these changes are called reorgs and some of these changes are called forks.</description></item><item><title>Interfacing with Python via python-bitcoinlib</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/python-bitcoinlib/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/python-bitcoinlib/</guid><description>python-bitcoinlib repo: https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib

Intro I will be talking about python-bitcoinlib.
whoami First I am going to start with an introduction slide. This is because I keep forgetting who I am so I have to write it down in all of my presentations. (Joke)
Before I get started, there is a presentation right after mine that is about libbitcoin.</description></item><item><title>SIGHASH_NOINPUT (BIP118)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/sighash-noinput/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/sighash-noinput/</guid><description>SIGHASH_NOINPUT (BIP118)
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1049510702384173057
Hi, my name is Bryan, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about SIGHASH NOINPUT. It was something that I was asked to speak about. It is currently not deployed, but it is an active proposal.
So, just really brief about who I am. I have a software development background. I just left LedgerX last week, so that is an exciting change in my life. Also, I contribute to bitcoin core, usually as code review.</description></item><item><title>Wallet Security, Key Management &amp; Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/wallet-security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/wallet-security/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1049813559750746112
Intro Alright, I’m now going to talk about bitcoin wallet security. And I was asked to talk about key management and hardware security modules and a bunch of other topics all in one talk. This will be a bit broader than some of the other talks because this is an important subject about how do you actually store bitcoin and then some of the developments around the actual storage of bitcoin in a secure way.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Custody</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/bitcoin-custody/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/bitcoin-custody/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1048014038179823617
Start time: 6:09:50
My name is Bryan Bishop, I’m going to be talking about bitcoin custody. Here is my PGP fingerprint, we should be doing that. So who am I, I have a software development background, I don’t just type transcripts. I’m actually no longer at LedgerX as of Friday (Sept 21 2018) when I came here. That is the end of 4 years, so you are looking at a free man.</description></item><item><title>Snarks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/snarks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/snarks/</guid><description>some setup motivating topics:
