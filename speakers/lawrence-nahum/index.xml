What kind of tools do we need to create, in order to facilitate building on bitcoin? We are going to open questions to the floor. The guys will be there to get your questions. The panel will be about 20 minutes long, and then we will go for food.
LN: I work at Blockstream. I work on low-level wallets and tooling for wallets.
ND: I am working on a library called Nbitcoin for programming bitcoin in C#.</description></item><item><title>The Future Of Bitcoin Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-future-of-bitcoin-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-future-of-bitcoin-wallets/</guid><description>1 on 1: The future of bitcoin wallets

GZ: Thank you very much. We&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the future of bitcoin wallets. As you know, it&amp;rsquo;s a very central topic. We always compare bitcoin to the internet. Wallets are basically like browsers like back at the beginning of the web. They are the first gateway to a user experience for users on bitcoin. It&amp;rsquo;s important to see how they will evolve.</description></item></channel></rss>
