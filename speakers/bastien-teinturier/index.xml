Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about Lightning privacy, splicing and other very cool things with an absolute amazing panel here. Just before that, I have a couple of things that I want to set out some updates. So OpenSats is now taking grants for a Bitcoin application, sorry, taking grant applications for Bitcoin projects and Nostra projects and Lightning projects. And there is about five mil for an OSTER, five mil for Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2022-03-01-lightning-panel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2022-03-01-lightning-panel/</guid><description>Topic: The Lightning Network in 2022

Introduction Buenos Dias San Salvador, I&amp;rsquo;m Bastien. Hopefully my slides are going to come up. Oh yay, perfect. So I&amp;rsquo;m working on the Lightning Protocol Specification and one of its main implementation at Acinq.
I&amp;rsquo;m here to talk to you about privacy. This is a big topic. It&amp;rsquo;s not a black and white thing. There are various degrees of gray when you talk about what your threat model is, who you want to protect against.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Protocol Privacy Exploration</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-11-07-t-bast/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-11-07-t-bast/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/319/
Stephan Livera:
T-Bast, welcome to the show.
T-Bast:
Hey, Stephan. Thanks for having me.
Stephan Livera:
So Bastien, I prefer definitely having good technical discussions about the Lightning Network. And I know you’ve got a lot of things to talk about. For people who don’t know you, do you want to just tell us a little bit about yourself?
T-Bast:
Yeah, sure. I started working on Lightning a few years ago.</description></item><item><title>Trampoline Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-bastien-teinturier-trampoline-routing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-bastien-teinturier-trampoline-routing/</guid><description>The Lightning Conference Day 2 (Stage 2)

Intro We will start with gory technical details about routing and pathfinding. I hope I will be able to keep you awake for the next twenty minutes. I’m working for ACINQ on the Lightning Network. If you don’t know ACINQ we are contributors to the specification. We run the biggest node on the network and we are also one of the leading mobile wallets, eclair-mobile.</description></item></channel></rss>
