This is joint work with some people I work with at UMass, including Gavin Andresen.
The problem I am going to focus on in this presentation is how to relay information to a new block, to a neighbor, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about next. This would be on the fast relay network or on the regular p2p network.
