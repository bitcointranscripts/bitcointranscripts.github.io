It really needs to be careful very carefully. A friend had the idea to achieve 2 out of 3 protection from my wallet seed by storing the seed in the following way:
Location 1: seed words 1-8 and 9-16 Location 2: seed words 1-8 and 17-24 Location 3: seed words 9-16 and 17-24
It sounds a lot like Shamir’s Secret Sharing scheme but easier.</description></item><item><title>Mastering Lightning &amp; Using BTCPayServer</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-01-06-andreas-antonopoulos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-01-06-andreas-antonopoulos/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/139/
Stephan Livera: Andreas, welcome back to the show.
Andreas: It’s a pleasure. Thank you so much for having me again.
Stephan Livera: Oh, it’s, yeah, I know you’re doing, you’ve got a lot on, I know a couple months ago, you announced recently alongside Laolu Osuntukun and Rene Pickhardt that you’re working on Mastering Lightning. I’m excited to see the result of that. Let’s talk a little bit about how that came about.</description></item><item><title>Are Hardware Wallets Secure Enough?</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2019-02-01-andreas-antonopoulos-hardware-wallet-security/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2019-02-01-andreas-antonopoulos-hardware-wallet-security/</guid><description>Q - Hi Andreas. I store my crypto on a Ledger. Listening to Trace Mayer this week has me concerned that this is not safe enough. Trace says you need Bitcoin Core for network validation, Armory for managing the private keys and a Glacier protocol for standard operating procedures and a Purism laptop for hardware. What is the gold standard for storing crypto for non-technical people? Is a hardware wallet good enough?</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Q&amp;A: Initial Blockchain Download</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-23-andreas-antonopoulos-initial-blockchain-download/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-23-andreas-antonopoulos-initial-blockchain-download/</guid><description>Becca asks why does it take it so long to download the blockchain? I do have a fast internet connection and I could download 200GB in less than a hour. What Becca is talking about is what’s called the initial blockchain download or IBD which is the first synchronization of the Bitcoin node or any kind of blockchain node to its blockchain. The answer is that while the amount of data you need to download in order to get the full blockchain is about 200GB or so you’re not simply downloading that and storing it on disk.</description></item><item><title>Schnorr Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-07-andreas-antonopoulos-schnorr-signatures/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-07-andreas-antonopoulos-schnorr-signatures/</guid><description>LTB Episode 378 - The Petro inside Venezuela &amp;amp; Schnorr Signatures
We’re currently using the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) which is a specific way of doing digital signatures with elliptic curves but not the only way. Schnorr signatures have some unique characteristics that make them better in many ways than the ECDSA algorithm we use today in Bitcoin.
Schnorr signatures are better because they have certain quirks in the way the mathematics plays out.</description></item><item><title>Full Node and Home Network Security</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-08-30-andreas-antonopoulos-home-network-security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-08-30-andreas-antonopoulos-home-network-security/</guid><description>Does running a Bitcoin full node attract hackers to my home network? Q - Does running a Bitcoin full node and/or a Lightning node at home attract hackers to my IP address and home network? Also could it reveal ownership of Bitcoin and attract physical attacks? Are preconfigured full node starter kits safe to use for non-technical people or is this completely against the point of running a full node and thus non-technical people should abandon the idea?</description></item><item><title>On Consensus and All Kinds of Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2017-06-04-consensus-uasf-and-forks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2017-06-04-consensus-uasf-and-forks/</guid><description>User activated soft forks vs hard forks Adam Levine (AL): I’m trying to look at the user activated soft fork thing and not see hypocrisy just steaming out of its ears. I’m really in need of you to help me understand why this is not the case Andreas. The argument to this point about scaling, one of the arguments, one of the larger arguments, has been that hard forks are the worst thing that can happen.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Bitcoin Scripting</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-04-03-andreas-antonopoulos-bitcoin-scripting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2017-04-03-andreas-antonopoulos-bitcoin-scripting/</guid><description>Mastering Bitcoin on GitHub: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook
Intro Today’s talk is different from some of the other talks I’ve done so bear with me. We are going to do this slowly in a very casual manner. This is not one of my usual talks where I am going to tell you about big picture vision and stuff like that. What I want to do is talk about some interesting features of Bitcoin Script and explain them.</description></item><item><title>Canada Senate Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2014-10-08-andreas-antonopolous-canada-senate-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2014-10-08-andreas-antonopolous-canada-senate-bitcoin/</guid><description>This is a transcript of submitted evidence to the Parliament of Canada&amp;rsquo;s Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.

Up next, we have Andreas Antonopoulos.
So I may make this a bit difficult for the camera because I hate standing behind the podium. Welcome everyone. How are you, thank you for coming. How many people in this audience own Bitcoin?
So I usually start my question with that. And most audiences that gives me an accurate representation. You gave Bitcoin to every undergraduate, so you ruined my polling ability.</description></item></channel></rss>
