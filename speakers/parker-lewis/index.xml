Thank you all for coming. We have some bitcoin contributors here, and some people from the investment community. The impetus for this event was a bitcoin conference this weekend, but also Gideon is speaking today. We went to a blockchain event a few months ago and it was our impression that they didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job of explaining bitcoin to investors. Since we&amp;rsquo;re all up here in Dallas, we thought we would share some perspectives about what bitcoin is and how it works for people that are actively contributing in the space.</description></item></channel></rss>
