Antoine and Salvatori, welcome to the show.
Antoine :
Thanks for having us.
Salvatore :
Thank you, Stephan.
Stephan :
So I know you guys are both building out some stuff in Miniscript. Obviously, software and hardware. And I know this is an interesting area, there’s been a bit of discussion about it, but there’s also been some critique about it as well. So I’d be interested to get into this with you guys, but maybe first if we could start.</description></item><item><title>Revault - A Multiparty Vault Architecture</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-05-26-kevin-loaec-antoine-poinsot-revault/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-05-26-kevin-loaec-antoine-poinsot-revault/</guid><description>Location: London Bitcoin Devs (online)

Intro (Michael Folkson) This is London Bitcoin Devs. This is on Zoom and live-streaming on YouTube. Last week we had a Socratic Seminar on vaults, covenants and CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. There is a video up for that. There is also a transcript, @btctranscripts on Twitter. Regarding questions Kevin and Antoine are going to pause during the presentation for questions and comments. We are not going to have interruptions so we will let them speak until they pass.</description></item><item><title>Revault</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/honey-badger-diaries/2020-04-24-kevin-loaec-antoine-poinsot-revault/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/honey-badger-diaries/2020-04-24-kevin-loaec-antoine-poinsot-revault/</guid><description>Revault Bitcoin vaults
Location: Honey Badger Diaries (podcast)
Transcript (abridged) Aaron: So you guys built something. First tell me are you a company? Is this a startup? What is the story here?
Kevin: My personal interest in vaults started last year when Bryan Bishop published his email on the mailing list. I was like “That is an interesting concept.” After that I started engaging with him on Twitter proposing a few different ideas.</description></item></channel></rss>
