Pieter Wuille on Chaincode podcast discussing consensus rules: https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-01-28-pieter-wuille/#part-2
Intro Hi everyone. I’m Carl Dong from Chaincode Labs and I’m here to talk about libbitcoinkernel, a project I’ve been working on that aims to extract Bitcoin Core’s consensus engine. When we download and run Bitcoin Core it is nicely packaged into a single bundle, a single application. However those of us who have studied the blade know that Bitcoin Core just like most applications is in fact a collection of subsystems.</description></item><item><title>Modularizing the Bitcoin Consensus Engine</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/modularizing-the-bitcoin-consensus-engine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/modularizing-the-bitcoin-consensus-engine/</guid><description>AJ: Do you want to talk about isolating the consensus engine?
CD: Sure. More recently I have dove into the codebase a little bit more. That started with looking at Matt’s async ProcessNewBlock work and playing around with that. Learning from that how do you make a change to the core engine of Bitcoin Core.
Matt Corallo’s PR on async ProcessNewBlock https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16175
AJ: Can you talk about that PR a little bit and what it would do?</description></item><item><title>Reproducible Builds</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-30-carl-dong-reproducible-builds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-podcast/2020-11-30-carl-dong-reproducible-builds/</guid><description>Carl Dong’s presentation at Breaking Bitcoin 2019 on “Bitcoin Build System Security”: https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/breaking-bitcoin/2019/bitcoin-build-system/
Intro Adam Jonas (AJ): Welcome to the Chaincode podcast Carl.
Carl Dong (CD): Hello.
AJ: You know we’ve been doing this podcast for a while now. How come you haven’t been on the show yet?
CD: We’ve been at home.
AJ: We did a few episodes before that though.
Murch (M): It is fine. We’ve got you now.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Build System Security</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/bitcoin-build-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/bitcoin-build-system/</guid><description>Alternative video without the Q&amp;amp;A session: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2iShmUTEl8

I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to Amsterdam this year, but I hope the graphics I have prepared for this talk can make up for my absence. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to be a good bitcoin citizen and start to run your own bitcoin node. Say you go to bitcoincore.org, you click the download button, and you open the disk image and you double click on Bitcoin Core.</description></item><item><title>Reproducible Builds</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/reproducible-builds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/reproducible-builds/</guid><description>Reproducible builds, binaries and trust
Carl Dong (Chaincode Labs)
Introduction I am Carl and I work at Chaincode Labs and I will be talking about software, binaries and trust. I am happy that Ethan talked about his subject because it ties into my talk. For the purposes of this talk, assume that everything is perfect and there&amp;rsquo;s no bugs and no CVEs and all the things that Ethan talked about don&amp;rsquo;t exist.</description></item></channel></rss>
