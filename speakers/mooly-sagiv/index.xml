In formal verification, we really look for bugs. We can identify subtle bugs, like reentrancy attacks, ownership violation, incorrect transactions, bugs due to updated code. We also want to assure the absence of bugs.
Device drivers I come from the domain of Windows device drivers. These are drivers produced by third parties, and it integrates with operating system code.</description></item><item><title>Finding Bugs Automatically in Smart Contracts with Parameterized Specifications</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/smart-contract-bug-hunting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/smart-contract-bug-hunting/</guid><description>https://www.certora.com/pubs/sbc2020.pdf

Introduction I am from Tel Aviv University and now we have a 1-year old company called Cotera which is located in Berlin, Seattle and Tel Aviv. Our mission is to bring formal methods into code security and I will talk to you today about how we use this method to find bugs. And actually, I try to make this talk as informal as possible but there is actually a paper just download it from the certora website.</description></item></channel></rss>
