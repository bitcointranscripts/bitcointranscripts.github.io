Thanks everyone for staying here and not going to the next room. Thanks for the organizers for inviting me. Today I am going to talk about Rootstock. It&amp;rsquo;s a codename for a smart contracting platform that we are developing for SKY labs, which is a company we founded in 2015.</description></item></channel></rss>
