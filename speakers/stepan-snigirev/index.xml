It is Stepan Snigirev from Specter, he is the CTO of Specter Solutions and has been working on Bitcoin software and hardware wallets for 3 years now so welcome Stepan.
Overview (Stepan Snigirev) What I want to talk about is Taproot on hardware wallets. We recently got the Taproot upgrade, yay, this is awesome. It activated in November.</description></item><item><title>Specter Desktop Bitcoin Multi Sig</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-08-28-stepan-snigirev-and-ben-kaufman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-08-28-stepan-snigirev-and-ben-kaufman/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/205/
Stephan Livera:
Stepan and Ben, welcome to the show.
Stepan:
Thank you. Thank you, Stephan. It’s very nice to be here again.
Ben:
Thank you for inviting me.
Stephan Livera:
Stepan I know you’ve been on the show twice before, but perhaps just for any listeners who are a little bit newer, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
Stepan:
We are doing well originally I came from quantum physics into Bitcoin and started working on hardware stuff mostly.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallet Design Best Practices</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/hardware-wallet-design-best-practices/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/hardware-wallet-design-best-practices/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1171322716303036417
Introduction We have 30 minutes. This was a talk by me and Jimmy but Jimmy talked for like 5 hours yesterday so I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking today.
Imagine you want to start working in bitcoin development. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance you will end up using a hardware wallet. In principle, it&amp;rsquo;s not any different from other software development. There&amp;rsquo;s still programming involved, like for firmware. Wallets have certain features and nuances compared to software wallets.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-06-29-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/austin-bitcoin-developers/2019-06-29-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1145019634547978240

That&amp;rsquo;s where I met M where he was the teaching assistant. Basically, you write a python bitcoin library from scratch. The API for this library and the classes and fnuctions that Jimmy uses is very easy to read and understand.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Wallets (History of Attacks)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-05-01-stepan-snigirev-hardware-wallet-attacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-05-01-stepan-snigirev-hardware-wallet-attacks/</guid><description>Slides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/64s3mtmt3efijxo/Stepan%20Snigirev%20on%20hardware%20wallet%20attacks.pdf

Introduction This talk is the second in the series after my previous talk in London a few months ago at the Advancing Bitcoin conference. There I was talking mostly about general attacks on hardware, more from the theoretical perspective. I didn’t say anything bad hardware wallets that exist and I didn’t specify anything on the bad side. Here I feel a bit more free as it is a meetup not a conference so I can say bad things about everyone.</description></item><item><title>The Future of Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/future-of-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/future-of-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>D419 C410 1E24 5B09 0D2C 46BF 8C3D 2C48 560E 81AC

Introduction We are making a secure hardware platform for developers so that they can build their own hardware wallets. Today I want to talk about certain challenges for hardware wallets, what we&amp;rsquo;re missing, and how we can get better.
Current capabilities of hardware wallets Normally, hardware wallets keep keys reasonably secret and are able to spend coins or sign transactions.</description></item></channel></rss>
