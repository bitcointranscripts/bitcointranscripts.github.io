They have a room this afternoon and they are offering to talk with you one on one. So Marco and James.
You missed the introduction. Was it any good? (laughter)

Delaware initiative
It&amp;rsquo;s good to see so many friendly audiences in the audience. I am at Pillsbury Wintrhop Shaw Pittman. We are focusing on distinct areas of law as it applies to blockchain tech. We have been in the space as early as 2011 so we were trying to do the land grab. My team has been asked by the State of Delaware to serve as legal ambassadors to the blockchain industry.</description></item></channel></rss>
