We often see people saying they are testing the waters, they fixed a typo, they made a tiny little fix that doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact much, they are getting used to the process. They are finding that it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to contribut to Bitcoin Core. You code your changes, you submit your changes, there&amp;rsquo;s not much to it.
There&amp;rsquo;s a difference, and the lines are fuzzy and undefined, and you cna make a change to Core that changes a spelling error or a change to policy or consensus rules, for those high-level things, for ecosystem-level things, there&amp;rsquo;s several mailing lists, the dev list gets the most traffic.</description></item></channel></rss>
