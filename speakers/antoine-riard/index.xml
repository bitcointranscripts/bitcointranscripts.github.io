Intro Today Schnorr and Taproot for Lightning, it is a really exciting topic.
Lightning architecture The Lightning architecture for those who are not familiar with it. You have the blockchain as the underlying layer. On top of it you are going to build a channel, you have a HTLC and people are going to spend onions to you. If you want to be paid you are going to send an invoice to the sender.</description></item><item><title>Rust Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-antoine-riard-rust-lightning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-conference/2019/2019-10-20-antoine-riard-rust-lightning/</guid><description>Deploying rust-lightning in the wild

Intro Hi everyone, super happy to be here at the Lightning Conference. I’ve had an awesome weekend. Today I will talk on rust-lightning a project I’ve been contributing to for a year and a half. To get started, please take photos of the slides, not of me. So the story of rust-lightning. The idea was to build something really flexible, something really modular.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Sphinx And Onion Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-sphinx-and-onion-routing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2019/lightning-network-sphinx-and-onion-routing/</guid><description>Introduction Hi everyone. I am a developer of rust-lightning, it started in 2018 by BlueMatt. I started contributing about a year ago now. It&amp;rsquo;s a full featured, flexible, spec-compliant lightning library. It targets exchanges, wallet vendors, hardware, meshnet devices, and you can join us on Freenode IRC in the #rust-bitcoin channel which is a really nice one.
Privacy matters Privacy matters on the blockchain. This is the reason why lightning is taking so much time.</description></item></channel></rss>
