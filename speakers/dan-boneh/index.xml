Okay, we&amp;rsquo;re going to get started in five minutes. We&amp;rsquo;re going to get started. We have a fully packed day. Everybody can grab their seats and then we can get started.
Alright. So let&amp;rsquo;s do this.
Okay, welcome to the fourth Stanford Blockchain Conference. It&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of fun running this conference for a couple of years now. There&amp;rsquo;s a few quick administrative things I wanted to say.</description></item><item><title>Verifiable Delay Functions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/verifiable-delay-functions/vdf-day-2019/dan-boneh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/verifiable-delay-functions/vdf-day-2019/dan-boneh/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1152586087912673280
Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of VDFs and make sure that we&amp;rsquo;re on the same page. I want to make sure everyone knows what it is that we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.
The goal of a VDF is to slow things down. The question is, how do we slow things down in a verifiable way?
What is a VDF? I won&amp;rsquo;t give a precise definition, look at the manuscripts. A VDF is basically a function that is supposed to take T steps to evaluate, even if the honest party has polynomial parallelism.</description></item><item><title>Fireside chat with Dan Boneh</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/grincon/2019/dan-boneh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/grincon/2019/dan-boneh/</guid><description>TL: I was one of the founders of SF Bitcoin Devs with aantonop. I am also the co-founder of a company called Promise. We sponsor protocols in privacy as well as mimblewimble. If you are mining or actively looking to mine in grin, please say hello to me because we&amp;rsquo;re connected with a lot of mining companies and hosting companies that are looking to host miners very cheaply.

Introduction Hi. Thanks a lot for coming in after lunch. This slot is often known as &amp;ldquo;the slot of death&amp;rdquo;. Some of us are jetlagged, this is the perfect time to doze off and only wake up at the end of the talk. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to prevent that from happening. I think the best way to do that is to start about what this talk can do for you.</description></item><item><title>Dan Boneh</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-developers-miners-meeting-2016/dan-boneh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-developers-miners-meeting-2016/dan-boneh/</guid><description>A conversation with Dan Boneh
Part of the challenge was that the Google Maps directions in the email were going down some roads that had construction&amp;hellip;. been here 10 minutes, and some arriving in another 10 minutes. They are building a new biology building. Large campus here. In whatever direction you walk, there are buildings and more buildings. In two years there will be a new biology building, and two years later there will be a new computer science building.</description></item><item><title>Pairing Cryptography</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/pairing-cryptography/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/pairing-cryptography/</guid><description>Dan Boneh (see also 1)
