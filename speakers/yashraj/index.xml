Unlike traditional methods, silent payments use elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to generate unique addresses for each transaction without interaction. This preserves user privacy and simplifies the process. Josibake explains the design rationale, technical challenges, and implementation strategies. He emphasizes the need for widespread adoption of sending capabilities and highlights the potential applications in exchanges and other services. The discussion also covers the trade-offs between privacy and computational overhead, proposing solutions to ensure efficient implementation and user education.</description></item><item><title>Covenants</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-design/learning-bitcoin-and-design/covenants/</guid><description>Introductions Christoph Ono: 00:00:01
Welcome to our first Learning Bitcoin and Design call of 2024. We haven&amp;rsquo;t had one of these in a while, but we&amp;rsquo;re picking them back up again. The first topic is a really tough one, I think at least, it&amp;rsquo;s covenants. The reason, one of the reasons why this came up is because on Bitcoin Design, we have this new design challenge. We have a page with design challenges that are meant to be kind of take home challenges.</description></item></channel></rss>
