DeLisle explains the adversary tolerance of CJDNS and its use of public keys for communication verification. He also addresses concerns about the environmental impact of crypto mining and argues that it facilitates the transition to renewable energy sources. DeLisle emphasizes the attacks on decentralized finance and crypto by centralized entities and the importance of unity in the crypto community. He highlights the creation of PacketCrypt, a bandwidth-hard proof of work that incentivizes building out large amounts of bandwidth. DeLisle asserts the need to prioritize privacy, robustness, and resilience in the face of attacks and the value of positive engagement with policymakers. He also discusses the differences between CJDNS and other networking solutions, highlighting CJDNS&amp;rsquo;s focus on infrastructure and resilient internet access. In addition, DeLisle mentions the potential for individuals to provide internet access to their neighbors and the financing possibilities for the Packet Network Steward. Finally, he touches on the use of Rust programming language for code review and the productivity improvements it brings in terms of security.</description></item></channel></rss>
