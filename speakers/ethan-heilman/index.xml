Bitcoin’s P2P Network Please interrupt me. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go through this stuff a little bit quickly because I hear that you&amp;rsquo;ve already read Eclipse attack paper and you&amp;rsquo;ve already looked at some of the peer to peer stuff.
Bitcoin uses a peer-to-peer network to announce transactions and blocks. It makes 8 outgoing connections. These are TCP connections initiated by the node.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Chain Swaps: Atomically Swapping Coins for Privacy or Cross-Blockchain Trades</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/cross-chain-swaps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/cross-chain-swaps/</guid><description>Ethan and Nicolas describe atomic cross-chain swaps - a protocol where two parties can exchange coins as a single operation. The exchange does not require any trusted third party and neither of the parties involved can cheat each other. They describe how this can be used on a single blockchain as a privacy protocol or “cross-chain” as a trading protocol.</description></item><item><title>Blind Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/blind-signatures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/edgedevplusplus/2018/blind-signatures/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1047648050234060800

Introduction Hi everyone. I work at Commonwealth Crypto. Today I am going to be talking to you about blind signatures. I&amp;rsquo;d like to encourage people to ask questions. Please think of questions. I&amp;rsquo;ll give time and pause for people to ask questions.
What are blind signatures? A very informal definition of blind signatures is that they are a signature scheme that allows one party to sign a message without learning the message they signed.</description></item><item><title>TumbleBit: An Untrusted Bitcoin-Compatible Anonymous Payment Hub</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/tumblebit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/tumblebit/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/784686167052709888
Hi. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about tumblebit. It&amp;rsquo;s our untrusted private bitcoin payment system. Tumblebit provides payments which are private. They provide set anonymity when used as a classic tumbler. They are untrusted. The tumbler can&amp;rsquo;t violate your privacy, and can&amp;rsquo;t steal your coins. It&amp;rsquo;s also scalable. It&amp;rsquo;s compatible and works with today&amp;rsquo;s bitcoin. There are no malleability concerns. We&amp;rsquo;re going to rely on the constrained opcodes that currently exist in bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Atomically Trading With Roger Gambling On The Success Of A Hard Fork</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/atomically-trading-with-roger-gambling-on-the-success-of-a-hard-fork/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/atomically-trading-with-roger-gambling-on-the-success-of-a-hard-fork/</guid><description>Atomically Trading with Roger: Gambling on the success of a hard-fork
