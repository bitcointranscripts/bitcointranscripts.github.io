Stephan Livera:
Pavel welcome to the show.
Pavel Moravec:
Hello. Great to be here again.
Stephan Livera:
Yes, So, Pavel, I see you guys have been keeping busy over at Braiins and SlushPool. So you were one of the first pools or I think you were the first pool to signal for taproot, which is very cool. And we’re definitely going to get into some of that for listeners who don’t know much about you, can you just give us a little bit of a background on yourself?</description></item></channel></rss>
