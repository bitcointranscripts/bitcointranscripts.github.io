I probably won&amp;rsquo;t get through all of my material. If you have questions during the talk, please feel free to raise your hand and we can cover it right away. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to walk you through a transaction serialization for both a non-segwit transaction and a segwit transaction. By the end of the talk, I hope you understand how the transaction weight is calculated and how the witness discount works.</description></item><item><title>SLP321 On-chain scaling with Bitcoin Core Developers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-11-16-pieter-wuille-andrew-poelstra-andrew-chow-mark-erhardt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-11-16-pieter-wuille-andrew-poelstra-andrew-chow-mark-erhardt/</guid><description>podcast: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/321/

Introduction Thank you. ((applause))
Hi. Okay. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about coin selection. I have been doing this for my master thesis. To take you through what I will be talking about, I will be shortly outlining my work, then talking about coin selection in general. And then the design space of coin selection. I will also be introducing the framework I have been using for simulating coin selection.</description></item></channel></rss>
