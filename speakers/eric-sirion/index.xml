Stephan Livera:
Eric, welcome to the show.
Eric Sirion:
Hello. Yeah. Happy to be on. Nice to meet you.
Stephan Livera:
Yeah. So Eric, it was great to read about your proposal and read about what’s going on with MiniMint and all this stuff. And I think it’s definitely a topic that SLP listeners will be interested to hear about, ideas related to this, privacy, scalability, all sorts of things.</description></item></channel></rss>
