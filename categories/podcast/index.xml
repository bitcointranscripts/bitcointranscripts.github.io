Schnorr signatures We’re currently using the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) which is a specific way of doing digital signatures with elliptic curves but not the only way. Schnorr signatures have some unique characteristics that make them better in many ways than the ECDSA algorithm we use today in Bitcoin.
Schnorr signatures are better because they have certain quirks in the way the mathematics plays out.</description></item><item><title>CVE-2018-17144 Bug</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/noded-podcast/jnewbery-cve-2018-17144-bug/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/noded-podcast/jnewbery-cve-2018-17144-bug/</guid><description>Noded podcast September 26th 2018
Intros
Pierre: This is an issue that affects our audience directly, right. This is the Noded podcast. It is for people who run Bitcoin full nodes and we had what is called a critical vulnerability exposure - CVE drop on Monday and there was an issue with our node software - specific versions and we can get into that.
bitstein: And in a bombshell Tweet John Newbery said that he was responsible for the CVE.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Uasf And Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2017-06-04-consensus-uasf-and-forks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2017-06-04-consensus-uasf-and-forks/</guid><description>On Consensus and All Kinds of Forks

User activated soft forks vs hard forks Adam Levine (AL): I’m trying to look at the user activated soft fork thing and not see hypocrisy just steaming out of its ears. I’m really in need of you to help me understand why this is not the case Andreas. The argument to this point about scaling, one of the arguments, one of the larger arguments, has been that hard forks are the worst thing that can happen.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Barnacles</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2016-12-25-christopher-jeffrey-consensus-barnacles/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/lets-talk-bitcoin-podcast/2016-12-25-christopher-jeffrey-consensus-barnacles/</guid><description>Location: Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast (Episode 319)

BC: Adam Back is here for the second time on this show. Some of you will be familiar that Adam Back is the inventor of proof-of-work or hashcash as it was then. He was one of the few people cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. More recently he has been involved in sidechains and Blockstream where he is a founder.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Sidechains - Unchained Epicenter</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/bitcoin-sidechains-unchained-epicenter-adam3us-gmaxwell/</guid><description>EB65 – Adam Back &amp;amp; Greg Maxwell: Sidechains Unchained
people:
Sebastien Couture Brian Fabian Crain Adam Back (adam3us) Greg Maxwell (gmaxwell) Brian: We are here today we have Adam Back and Greg Maxwell, to anyone who is following bitcoin and bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s development, you will have probably heard of these two gentlemen. I was fortunate enough that the first time that I went to a bitcoin conference at the beginning of my involvement in this space, it was in Amsterdam 2013 and I somehow randomly ended up having dinner twice with Adam which really was super fascinating talking to him about bitcoin, and so I&amp;rsquo;m really exciting to have them on today, especially since we are going to have a chance to talk about a project we have talked about many times on this show before, with different people, which is sidechains, because sidechains I think that everyone is in agreement that it is one of the more interesting projects in the space, and a lot of people have many questions about it.</description></item><item><title>Mimblewimble Podcast</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/mimblewimble-podcast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/misc/mimblewimble-podcast/</guid><description>https://soundcloud.com/heryptohow/mimblewimble-andrew-poelstra-peter-wuille-brian-deery-and-chris-odom

I am going to introduce our guests here in just a minute.
Launch of zcash might be delayed in order to allow the code to be analyzed by multiple third-party auditors. Zooko stated, &amp;ldquo;I feel bad that we didn&amp;rsquo;t do a better job of making TheDAO disaster-like problems harder for people&amp;rdquo;.
