Giulia: So today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk to you about some work that my collaborators and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the last three years now. So this was joint work with a bunch of people who are now spread across a few different universities but it started at the University of Illinois: Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, Surya Bakshi, Brad Denby, Shruti Bhargava, Andrew Miller, Pramod Viswanath.</description></item><item><title>Transaction Rebroadcast</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-09-09-amiti-uttarwar-transaction-rebroadcast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-09-09-amiti-uttarwar-transaction-rebroadcast/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1199710296199385088

Introduction Hello. Thank you for joining me today. My name is Amiti and I’d like to tell you a bit about my Bitcoin journey.
Professional Background I graduated from Carnegie Mellon five years ago and ever since I’ve worked at a few different startups in San Francisco Bay Area. My adventures with blockchains began when I worked at Simbi. Simbi is a marketplace for trading and bartering services. Here I found a community of people who were living outside of their means.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Bitcoin Core</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-22-fabian-jahr-debugging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-22-fabian-jahr-debugging/</guid><description>Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/Debugging_Bitcoin.pdf

Introduction I’m talking about debugging Bitcoin and that means to me using loggers and debugging tools to work with Bitcoin and this is especially useful for somebody who is a beginner with Bitcoin development. Or even a beginner for C++ which I considered myself a couple of weeks ago actually. I’m going to tell the story of a fictional beginner to Bitcoin development. This disclaimer, while you may think you recognize some names just assume everything is made up because I made it all up.</description></item><item><title>Taproot Policy</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-22-james-chiang-taproot-policy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-22-james-chiang-taproot-policy/</guid><description>Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/Taproot_Policy.pdf
Introduction Hi my name is James and I have been a resident here at Chaincode. It has been a privilege. I hear they might be doing it again in the future, I highly recommend the experience, it has been really fantastic. I’ve been working on a demo library in Python for Taproot and that’s why I chose to talk about Taproot and policy today. Seemingly two separate topics but actually there are some very interesting implications for each other.</description></item><item><title>Schnorr Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-16-elichai-turkel-schnorr-signatures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-08-16-elichai-turkel-schnorr-signatures/</guid><description>Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/Schnorr_Signatures.pdf

Introduction I’m Elichai, I’m a resident here at Chaincode. Thanks to Chaincode for having us and having me. Most of you have probably heard about Taproot and Schnorr which are new technologies that we want to integrate into Bitcoin. Today I am going to explain what is Schnorr and why do we even want this?
Digital Signatures Before that we need to define what are digital signatures. In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a seminal paper called New Directions in Cryptography.</description></item><item><title>Multiparty Channels (Lightning Network)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-multiparty-channels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-multiparty-channels/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019

Symmetric Update Protocols eltoo Update Mechanism Two days ago, we’ve seen the symmetric update mechanism called eltoo, and having a symmetric update mechanism has some really nice properties that enable some really cool stuff. Just to remind everybody, this is what eltoo looks like. That’s the one you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. It’s not the only symmetric update mechanism, though.
Duplex Micropayment Channels It was predated by this stuff.</description></item><item><title>Rendezvous Routing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-rendezvous-routing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-rendezvous-routing/</guid><description>Rendezvous Routing (Lightning Network)

Transcript by: Caralie Chrisco and Davius Parvin
Introduction Okay, the second part is rendezvous routing. I basically already gave away the trick but I hope you all forgot. So what is rendezvous routing? Anybody have a good explanation of what we are trying to do here? So we have someplace where we meet in the middle, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to know where you live, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know where I live, we&amp;rsquo;re all really private.</description></item><item><title>Limitations of Lightweight Clients</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-fabrice-drouin-limitations-of-lightweight-clients/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-fabrice-drouin-limitations-of-lightweight-clients/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Introduction The limitations it&amp;rsquo;s uh you have to fight when you want to build lightweight clients mobile clients so this again, this is how mobile clients work, you scan payment requests, you have a view of the network that is supposed to be good enough, you compute the routes, you get an HTLC, you get a preimage back you&amp;rsquo;ve paid.
So a Lightning node is a Bitcoin node, as in, you have to be able to create, sign, and send Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network.</description></item><item><title>Path Finding in the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-path-finding-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-path-finding-lightning-network/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Residency 2019
Introduction Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk a little bit about path finding on the Lightning Network and some part of it will be about the gossip protocol which is like a little bit of a review of what the gossip messages are going to look like. So it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit basic again. But other than that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that you seek more for like opinionated talks and recent ideas instead of, like, how the bolts work because you already know all of that.</description></item><item><title>Splicing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-splicing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-splicing/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Transcript by: Caralie Chrisco
Introduction So splicing basically means you have a payment channel, you have a certain capacity of a payment channel and you want to change the capacity on the payment channel. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to change your balance right? For balance change,(inaudible) we&amp;rsquo;ll get some money on it. But splicing really means you want to change the capacity.
I mean the obvious way of doing this is close the channel, make a new channel with the design capacity and you could.</description></item><item><title>The Update Layer</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-update-layer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-26-rene-pickhardt-update-layer/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Introduction Maybe we had a wrong impression, you can ask, like in Christian’s talk, as many questions as you want while the presentation is there. So, it&amp;rsquo;s a small disclaimer just saying: these slides are part of a much larger slide set which is open-source and you find notes and, I think, we share slides in the Google Docs anyway.
The outline of the talk is, I’m going to talk about the construction of payment channels in Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Attack Vectors of Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-attack-vectors-of-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-attack-vectors-of-lightning-network/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Residency – Summer 2019
Introduction All right so I&amp;rsquo;m going to introduce really quickly attack vectors on Lightning. I focus on first what you can do with the Lightning protocol, but I will mostly speak about how attacks will probably happen in real life. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not going to be direct attacks on the protocol itself.
Denial of Service So the basic attacks you can have when you&amp;rsquo;re running lightning nodes are denial of service attacks basically.</description></item><item><title>Eltoo</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</guid><description>Eltoo: The (Far) Future of Lightning

Intro Who has never heard about eltoo? It is my pet project and I am pretty proud of it. I will try to keep this short. I was told that you all have seen my presentation about the evolution of update protocols. I will probably go pretty quickly. I still want to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions if they have any.</description></item><item><title>Multiple-path Payments (MPP)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-alex-bosworth-mpp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-alex-bosworth-mpp/</guid><description>Topic: Multiple-path Payments (MPP)
Location: Chaincode Residency 2019
Bigger, Faster, Cheaper - Multiplexing Payments Alex: How to do multiple path payments. So there&amp;rsquo;s a question: why do we even need multiple path payments? So you have a channel &amp;ndash; like &amp;ndash; we don&amp;rsquo;t have them now, so are we really hurting for them? So I kind of like describing different situations where you would need it. So in the first quadrant you can see I have two channels.</description></item><item><title>Onion Routing Deep Dive</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Residency – Summer 2019
Onion Routing Deep Dive But we&amp;rsquo;ve not seen exactly why we are using an onion, or why we chose this construction of an onion and how this construction of an onion actually looks like. So my goal right now is to basically walk you through the iterations that onion routing packets have done so far, and why we chose this construction we have here.</description></item><item><title>Routing Failures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-routing-failures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-routing-failures/</guid><description>Introduction So I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about routing failures in lightning. Basically lightning is a network of payment channels and you can pay anyone, you can find a route. In routing in lightning you have two completely different concepts: how to find a route (path finding) and once you have a route how to actually send a payment through the routes to the final destination. This is what Christian showed that&amp;rsquo;s the source routing.</description></item><item><title>Base and Transport Layers of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-base-and-transport-layers-of-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-base-and-transport-layers-of-lightning-network/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/lightning/Base_Transport.pdf
Introduction Fabrice: The base and transport layer, almost everything was already introduced this morning so it&amp;rsquo;s going to be very quick. So have you visited the lightning repo on GitHub? Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t?
Okay, good. So you&amp;rsquo;ve seen all this? That was a test.
We&amp;rsquo;ve covered almost everything this morning. I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna get back to the base protocol, BOLT 8 and maybe BOLT 9 because I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s been mentioned a lot.</description></item><item><title>Multihop of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-rene-pickhardt-multihop-in-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-rene-pickhardt-multihop-in-lightning/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/lightning/Multihop_Layer.pdf
Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about Lightning Network payment channels and the update layer which is basically multihop payments and the outline of this talk is one slide myths about routing that are floating around and I just want to discuss them in the beginning very briefly. Then I will talk about the payment process on the Lightning Network and compare it a little bit with the payment process on Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Core Wallet Development</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-19-john-newbery-wallet-development/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-19-john-newbery-wallet-development/</guid><description>Wallet Development in Bitcoin Core

Intro I am going to talk to you about wallets. As for the previous presentation I have all of the links in this document which I will share with you. First of all why should we care about wallets? Kind of boring right? You’ve had all this fun stuff about peer-to-peer and consensus. Wallets are just on the edge.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Segwit</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-18-james-obeirne-advanced-segwit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-18-james-obeirne-advanced-segwit/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs 2019 Residency

James O&amp;rsquo;Beirne: To sort of vamp off of Jonas&amp;rsquo;s preamble, I&amp;rsquo;m not that smart. I&amp;rsquo;m a decent programmer, but compared to a lot of people who work on Bitcoin, I barely know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I kind of consider myself like a carpenter, a digital carpenter equivalent. I&amp;rsquo;m a steady hand. I can get things done. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly patient, which i s key when it comes to Bitcoin Core development because, trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be doing a lot of waiting around and a lot of rebasing.</description></item><item><title>Security Models</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-17-john-newbery-security-models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-17-john-newbery-security-models/</guid><description>Topic: Security Models

Slides: https://residency.chaincode.com/presentations/bitcoin/security_models.pdf
John Newbery: Alright, Security Models. This is going to be like a quick whistle-stop tour of various things, very high-level view. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by giving you some kind of framework to think about things. So in cryptography, we often talk about security proofs in terms of existing schemes, we talk about assumptions.
So, for example&amp;hellip; If you can break new scheme B, then you&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to break old scheme A.</description></item><item><title>Network Partitioning Attacks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-12-ethan-heilman-network-partitioning-attacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-12-ethan-heilman-network-partitioning-attacks/</guid><description>Bitcoin network partitioning &amp;amp; network-level privacy attacks

Intro Good morning from the last day of presentations. I’m Chris still. Today I will be talking to you about c-lightning, how to develop on it, how to extend it, adapt it to your needs and how to customize it so it fits into whatever you are trying to do. Not whatever we thought you might want to do.
Goals First of all the goals of c-lightning are basically to be fast and lightweight.</description></item><item><title>Bootstrapping Lightning Node</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-elaine-ou-bootstrapping-lightning-node/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-elaine-ou-bootstrapping-lightning-node/</guid><description>Bootstrapping and maintaining a Lightning Node
Slides: https://lightningresidency.com/assets/presentations/Ou_Bootstrapping_and_Maintaining_a_Lightning_Node.pdf
Intro My name ie Elaine. I’ll talk about bootstrapping and maintaining a lightning node. Pretty much all of you have probably already set up a node so this should all be review. You guys will probably know more about this than I do.
Bootstrapping and Maintaining a Lightning Node We’ll start with an overview of how routing works just to understand what the nodes are trying to do and from there we’ll step back and look at ways of finding peers and getting incoming channels and maintaining capacity.</description></item><item><title>Building Lightning Applications</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-building-lightning-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-building-lightning-applications/</guid><description>Slides: https://lightningresidency.com/assets/presentations/Bosworth_Building_Applications.pdf
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1116327230135836673
Intro Today I’m going to talk about building on lnd from the perspective of we want to have developers building on lnd. Developers, developers, developers. I just have so many slides today that let’s leave questions to the end if I have any time because I over made slides.
Design Philosophy So what is the big idea behind lnd? What are we thinking about when we’re developing lnd and what do we want lnd to be?</description></item><item><title>Channel Management</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-channel-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-channel-management/</guid><description>Slides: https://lightningresidency.com/assets/presentations/Bosworth_Channel_Management.pdf
Intro Today I’m going to talk about something a little bit different to building apps. I’m going to talk about becoming a great router. Managing your node so that your node can be routing payments and be a good citizen if you choose to have public channels.
Uptime So basically the big message overall is and I think I’ve said this before, if you have public channels you’re kind of like waving to everybody “please use these channels to do routing”.</description></item><item><title>History of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018
Introduction Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Chris, as I said like three times before, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about the history of Lightning and history of off-chain protocols or layer two, or you name it, whatever name you want. I like to call them off chain because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply a hierarchy of layers but I&amp;rsquo;ll use all three terms interchangeably anyway.

So my job today is basically to tell you why Lightning is Bitcoin and why it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly Bitcoin. So there&amp;rsquo;s a few fundamental differences between Bitcoin on-chain payments and Lightning. I will always call Bitcoin on-chain payments just because it&amp;rsquo;s sort of the classical way of doing it.
The differences between Bitcoin and Lightning are sometimes small, sometimes bigger.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Protocol</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-lightning-protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-lightning-protocol/</guid><description>The Lightning Protocol, an Application Design Perspective
Slides: https://lightningresidency.com/assets/presentations/Bosworth_The_Lightning_Protocol.pdf
Intro I’m talking about the protocol design and also going through the BOLTs. What I’m going to talk about is also about the BOLTs. The BOLTs are like the spec for Lightning and there’s a bunch of them.
BOLT 00: Build Apps What I try to do is go through the BOLTs and look at only the parts of the BOLTs, the protocol design, that you as an app developer would need to care about.</description></item><item><title>Incentive Problems in the Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-09-18-alex-bosworth-incentive-problems-in-the-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-09-18-alex-bosworth-incentive-problems-in-the-lightning-network/</guid><description>Incentive Problems in the Lightning Network I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about high-level incentive problems in the Lighting Network.
Mechanisms The first thing to think about is that we have two different mechanisms for making Bitcoin and lightning work. One mechanism is math — If you do a SHA 256 of something you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about incentives, whether that&amp;rsquo;s going to match to the expected result. There&amp;rsquo;s no incentive there.</description></item><item><title>Fee Management (Lightning Network)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-fee-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-fabrice-drouin-fee-management/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Fabrice: So I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about fee management in Lightning which has been surprisingly one of the biggest operational issues we had when we launched the Lightning Network. So again the idea of Lightning is you have transactions that are not published but publishable, and in our case the problem is what does exactly publishable mean. So it means the UTXO that you’re spending is still spendable.</description></item><item><title>Lightning - The Transfer Layer</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-the-transfer-layer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-24-fabrice-drouin-the-transfer-layer/</guid><description>Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019
Context Fabrice: Alright so, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the payments model we use in lightning, which is mainly the HTLC, and how it works. So what we&amp;rsquo;ve explained so far is that a channel is basically a funding transaction that&amp;rsquo;s been published. And a commitment transaction that spends from the funding transaction but is not published. So the funding transaction is confirmed and it&amp;rsquo;s on-chain and it sends money to A and B.</description></item></channel></rss>
