We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about every single block size proposal. This is going to be the least technical presentation at the conference. I am not going to go into the proposals htemselves. Changing the block size itself is pretty simple. You change a constant. It&amp;rsquo;s more a discussion of algorithms, roll-out, etc.
What are some of the high level concerns with block size?</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Limit Trading Subsidy For Larger Blocks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/a-flexible-limit-trading-subsidy-for-larger-blocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/a-flexible-limit-trading-subsidy-for-larger-blocks/</guid><description>maaku

I really want to thank jgarzik for that interesting talk. Who picks what block size? My talk is going to be about a category of dynamic block size proposals that attach the block size limit to the fee in such a way that as there is more demand for block size, through users that want to pay fees, the block size will increase or decrease as necessary.</description></item><item><title>A Wishlist For Verifiable Computation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/a-wishlist-for-verifiable-computation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/a-wishlist-for-verifiable-computation/</guid><description>A wishlist for verifiable computation: An applied computer science perspective

Serialization Blocks are usually thought of as a serialized data stream. But really these are only true on the network serialization or over the network. A different implementation of bitcoin could in theory use a different format. The format is only used on the network and the disk, not the consensus protocol. The format could actually be completely different.</description></item><item><title>Accumulating Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bit-block-boom/2019/accumulating-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bit-block-boom/2019/accumulating-bitcoin/</guid><description>Accumulating bitcoin

Introduction Today I am going to be preaching to the choir I think. Hopefully I will be reiterating and reinforcing some points that you already know but maybe forgot to bring up with your nocoiner friends, or learning something new. I hope there&amp;rsquo;s something for everyone in here.
Q: Should I buy bitcoin?
A: Yes.
Q: Are you going to troll a journalist?

Introduction I am going to be talking about batching techniques for accumulators with applications to interactive oracle proofs and blockchains. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe also talk about how to make these proofs even smaller. The main thing that we are going to focus on today is the bitcoin state and this application of accumulators to bitcoin and blockchain.
Bitcoin UTXO states The bitcoin state is the UTXO set.</description></item><item><title>Alex Bosworth - Major Limitations of Lightning (2019-04-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-alex-bosworth-major-limitations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-alex-bosworth-major-limitations/</guid><description>Alex Bosworth

I am talking about block size, but not any particular proposal. Why do we have the block size limit and is it a good thing in the first place? The block size exists as a denial-of-service limiter. It limits the amount of resources that a node validating the blockchain can exhaust when validating a block. We want to do this because in the early days of bitcoin there are often certain kinds of transactions there are ways to slow down a validator by using a non-standard transaction or filling up a block with tons of spam.</description></item><item><title>Amiko Pay</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/amiko-pay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/amiko-pay/</guid><description>Amiko Pay

Amiko Pay aims to become an implementation of the lightning network. So that previous presentation was a great setup. There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit more to Amiko Pay. If you look through the basic design of the lightning network, there&amp;rsquo;s a network of payment channels. There have been several variations of this idea. Lightning Network happens to be the best so far. What Amiko Pay aims to do is to focus on the nodes, and do the routing between nodes.</description></item><item><title>Analysis Of Dust In Utxo Based Cryptocurrencies</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/analysis-of-dust-in-utxo-based-cryptocurrencies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/analysis-of-dust-in-utxo-based-cryptocurrencies/</guid><description>An analysis of dust in UTXO-based cryptocurrencies

I think I got this one down to 20 minutes but no promises. I will keep an eye on the clock.</description></item><item><title>Andrew Poelstra - Taproot (2020-03-07)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2020/2020-03-07-andrew-poelstra-taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2020/2020-03-07-andrew-poelstra-taproot/</guid><description>Name: Andrew Poelstra

Introduction I am going ot talk about anonymous atomic locks for scalability and interoperability in payment-channel hubs. This is joint work with my colleagues.
Scalability I will try to keep this section as short as possible. This talk is also about scalability in bitcoin. You&amp;rsquo;re probably aware of the scalability issues. There is decentralized data structure recording each transaction in order to provide public verifiability.</description></item><item><title>Anonymous Bitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/anonymous-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/anonymous-bitcoin/</guid><description>Adam Ficzor (nopara73)

One year ago I was standing here at this conference and Igave a talk. Today I am standing here and I titled my talk &amp;ldquo;Anonymous bitcoin&amp;rdquo;. One year ago at this conference, the conference was named &amp;ldquo;breaking bitcoin&amp;rdquo;. I did not break bitcoin. Someone else did, you might remember.
Today I want to present how I build on bitcoin.

Abstract Metering is an approach developed to assign cost to smart contract execution in blockchain systems such as Ethereum. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the metering approach based on gas taken by the Ethereum blockchain. We discover a number of discrepancies in the metering model such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the instructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation between the gas and resources such as CPU and memory.</description></item><item><title>Aurora Transparent Succinct Arguments R1Cs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/aurora-transparent-succinct-arguments-r1cs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/aurora-transparent-succinct-arguments-r1cs/</guid><description>Aurora: Transparent succinct arguments for R1CS

My perspective on this is that scaling bitcoin is an engineer problem. My favorite proposal for how to scale bitcoin is bip101. It&amp;rsquo;s over a 20-year time span.

We are going to focus on consensus rules. I am going to give an introduction and then focus on controversial versus non-controversial hard-forks.
Why do we want to classify consensus changes in the first place?

In the first, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a retrospective of the past 10 years of bitcoin as a functioning economic system. In the second part, I will be looking at bitcoin as it is today and how it will be in the future.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Assets</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/bitcoin-assets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/bitcoin-assets/</guid><description>Assets on bitcoin

Good morning everybody. In the mean time, while my presentation loads, I am Giacomo Zucco. I am the founder of BHB network and a consulting company. We do bitcoin consulting for institutional customers especially in Switzerland. We also like development on top of bitcoin and things like that.
My talk today is about assets on bitcoin. The subtitlte is &amp;ldquo;Yes, ok, financial sovereignity and cryptoanarchy are cool, but what about those cryptokitties?</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Block Propagation Iblt Rusty Russell</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/bitcoin-block-propagation-iblt-rusty-russell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/bitcoin-block-propagation-iblt-rusty-russell/</guid><description>Rusty Russell
This is not what I do. But I was doing it anyway.
The problem is that blocks are transmitted in their entirety. If you have a 1 MB uplink and you&amp;rsquo;re connecting to 8 peers, your first peer will see a 1MB block in about 66.8 seconds. And the last one will get it in 76.4 seconds, because we basically blast out blocks in parallel to our peers. Miners can solve this problem of slow block transmission by centralizing and all using the same pool.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Build System</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/bitcoin-build-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/bitcoin-build-system/</guid><description>Bitcoin build systems and bitcoin build system security

Introduction Alright guys. Come on in. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of seats, guys. If you&amp;rsquo;re sitting out on the edge, be nice to the other folks and get in the middle. Sitting at the edge is kind of being a dick. You&amp;rsquo;re not letting anyone through. Come on guys, you don&amp;rsquo;t have USB-C yet?

Introduction I am going to talk about a programmer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. As investors, you might find this interesting, but at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely actionable. As a programmer, the bitcoin ecosystem is very attractive. This is true of cryptocurrencies in general. I&amp;rsquo;ll make a distinction for bitcoin at the end. One of the interesting things is that you see some of the most talented hackers in the world are extremely attracted to bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Failure Modes And The Role Of The Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/bitcoin-failure-modes-and-the-role-of-the-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/bitcoin-failure-modes-and-the-role-of-the-lightning-network/</guid><description>Thaddeus Dryja
Joseph Poon
I am going to be talking about bitcoin failure modes, and Joseph will talk about how the lightning network can help. I&amp;rsquo;ll start. We&amp;rsquo;ll start off by saying that bitcoin is working, which is really cool. Blocks starts with lots of zeroes, coins stay put, they move when you tell them to. That&amp;rsquo;s really cool and it works. That&amp;rsquo;s great. This is a good starting place. We should acknowledge that bitcoin can fail.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Financing And Trading</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/bitcoin-financing-and-trading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/bitcoin-financing-and-trading/</guid><description>Joshua Lim (Circle, ex Goldman Sachs) Juthica Chou (LedgerX) (Goldman Sachs) Bobby Cho (ItBit) (VP of trading at SecondMarket) Harry Yeh (moderator) (Binary Financial) Today we will hear from some people who are traders and also infrastructure providers.

Bitcoin load spike simulation
Our goal for this project, our rationale of what we&amp;rsquo;re interesting is when many transactions arrive in a short period of time. This could be because of denial of service attacks where few entities are creating a large number of transactions, or many people wanting to create transactions, like a shopping spree. We wanted to answer two questions, how does the temporary spike in transaction rate affect confirmation delay distribution?</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Maximalism Dissected</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/bitcoin-maximalism-dissected/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/bitcoin-maximalism-dissected/</guid><description>Bitcoin maximalism dissected
Giacomo Zucco (giacomozucco)
Good morning everyone. I am very happy to be here at Baltic Honeybadger. Last year I gave a scaling presentation. I opened the conference with a scaling presentation. This year in order to compensate, I will be super serious. This will be the most boring presentation at the conference. I am going to try to dissect and formalize bitcoin maximalism.

Introduction I am an economist. I am going to stop apologizing about this now that I&amp;rsquo;ve said it once. I usually study market design. Bitcoin gives us new opportunities for how to design marketplaces. Regarding the talk title, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to claim that bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will be a monopoly.

I have some guests with me today. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talkin gabout merchant processing and talk about regular bitcoin adoption too.

This is a brief history of bitcoin script evolution. Since bitcoin was active in 2009, there was a lot of emergency fixes for the first 2 years done by Satoshi. He found that people could skpi the signature check using OP_RETURN and malformed scriptSigs. So those functions were removed. OP_VER and OP_VERIF were intended for script upgrades but it was found that after every release of bitcoin, it would become a hard-fork because of the design.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Security</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-security/</guid><description>Dhruv Bansal

This is shared work with my collaborators and coauthors.
Smart contracts I am sure everyone here knows what a smart contract is. It&amp;rsquo;s a program that can move cryptoassets. It&amp;rsquo;s executed in a decentralized environment. Generally speaking, we can say there&amp;rsquo;s two classes of smart contracts. A smart contract is a program.

Introduction Hi everyone. I work at Commonwealth Crypto. Today I am going to be talking to you about blind signatures. I&amp;rsquo;d like to encourage people to ask questions. Please think of questions. I&amp;rsquo;ll give time and pause for people to ask questions.
What are blind signatures?

I want to introduce the blind Schnorr signature in a few moments.
Schnorr signature My assumption is not that you will completely understand Schnorr signatures, but maybe you will at least agree that if you can understand Schnorr signatures then the step to blind Schnorr signatures is not a big step.</description></item><item><title>Block Rewards</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/block-rewards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/block-rewards/</guid><description>An Axiomatic Approach to Block Rewards

Block synchronization is how nodes join the market. New nodes download the blockchain and validate everything. This is how the security of the network works. Who is responsible for doing this? Everyone must be doing a full block synchronization. If you are not doing this, you&amp;rsquo;re not on the bitcoin network. As a simple hypothesis, the block size growth is related to initial block synchronization as a simple function of the integral.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain Database Technology In A Global Context</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/blockchain-database-technology-in-a-global-context/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/blockchain-database-technology-in-a-global-context/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

We can try to tune the parameters. In all of the plots, I have time going from left to right and these are blocks in rectangles. We have larger blocks which might give us more throughput.</description></item><item><title>Blockchains For Multiplayer Games</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/blockchains-for-multiplayer-games/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/blockchains-for-multiplayer-games/</guid><description>Blockchains for multiplayer games

Introduction Alright, thanks everyone for being here. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started. I am part of a project called Forte which wants to equip the game ecosystem with blockchain finance for their in-game economies. This is a unique set of constraints compared to what a lot of people are trying to build on blockchain today. We&amp;rsquo;re game experts. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely people more experts than us on the topics we&amp;rsquo;ll cover in this presentation, but what we want you to come away with is our best sense for the best path to get game economies running on blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Blocksci Platform</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/blocksci-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/blocksci-platform/</guid><description>BlockSci: a Platform for Blockchain Science and Exploration

Introduction Hi. I am Souyma and I am here to talk with you about Bloxroute. The elephant in the room is that blockchains have been claimed to solve everything like credit cards, social media, and global micropayments. To handle credit card payment volumes, blockchains need like 5000 transactions per second, for microtransactions you need 70000 transactions per second, and for social media even more.</description></item><item><title>Bolt Anonymous Payment Channels For Decentralized Currencies</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/bolt-anonymous-payment-channels-for-decentralized-currencies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/bolt-anonymous-payment-channels-for-decentralized-currencies/</guid><description>Bolt: Anonymous Payment Channels for Decentralized Currencies

Introduction Redundancy can be a useful tool for speeding up payment channel networks and improving throughput. We presented last week at Financial Crypto. You just received a nice introduction to payment channels and payment channel networks.
Payment channels Alice and Bob are connected through a payment channel. This is a channel and in that channel there are some coins that are escrowed.</description></item><item><title>Bootstrapping Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/bootstrapping-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/bootstrapping-lightning-network/</guid><description>Bootstrapping LN: What have we learned?

I work for SolidX in New York. I am here to tell you about some modifications to the blockchain. All the things we heard yesterday about the block size, come down to the existence of orphans. The reason why we have these problems are orphans. These are consequences of physics and resources. This is not a fundamental property in Bitcoin.

Inclusivitiy So it seems like we have two big topics here, one is braiding and one is proof-of-publication. I had a talk in Hong Kong about braiding. The major difference is the inclusive nature. The notion that every block gets a block reward as a way to solve selfish-mining. It&amp;rsquo;s a competition between the orphans that get a reward and the ones that don&amp;rsquo;t that causes a loss of security.</description></item><item><title>Breaking Wasabi</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-wasabi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-wasabi/</guid><description>Breaking wasabi and automated wallets

This presentation might include bad jokes about bitcoin personalitites. It might have some multiplication. I might say &amp;ldquo;ethereum&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s also a coinjoin warning.

My name is Christopher Allen, I am with Blockstream and today I wanted to give you an introduction to something that isn’t about consensus, isn’t about proof of stake and other things. I want to pop up a level. I want to talk about smart signatures.</description></item><item><title>Christopher Jeffrey Consensus Pitfalls (2017-09-10)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/2017-09-10-christopher-jeffrey-consensus-pitfalls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2017/2017-09-10-christopher-jeffrey-consensus-pitfalls/</guid><description>Name: Christopher Jeffrey (JJ)

Intro I’d like to talk about breaking Bitcoin today. Before I do that I’d like to give a short demonstration.
Demo Right now I am SSH’d into a server with a couple of nodes on it. I am going to start up a bitcoind node and I am going to connect to one of these nodes and have it serve me a chain.</description></item><item><title>Clearing And Settlement For Global Financial Institutions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/clearing-and-settlement-for-global-financial-institutions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/clearing-and-settlement-for-global-financial-institutions/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

Let&amp;rsquo;s start with what isn&amp;rsquo;t client-side validation. I am going to call this the miner-side approach. Here&amp;rsquo;s some smart contract code. In this example, it&amp;rsquo;s Chronos which is a timestamping contract. What you have here is a contract that stores in ethereum state consensus some hashes as they are received, they are timestamped. And ultimately at some point in the future you could go and ask the ethereum state machine, you know, did you go and get this hash?</description></item><item><title>Clockwork Nonfrontrunning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/clockwork-nonfrontrunning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/clockwork-nonfrontrunning/</guid><description>ClockWork: An exchange protocol for proofs of non-front-running
Daniel Cline
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1231012112517844993
Introduction Clockwork is an exchange protocol for proofs of non-frontrunning.
Exchange systems Exchange systems let you trade one asset for another asset at a certain price. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be fair. In this work, we&amp;rsquo;re focused on centralized exchange systems. We&amp;rsquo;re not working with decentralized exchanges just yet. These don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to be cryptocurrency exchanges, either.</description></item><item><title>Coin Selection</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/coin-selection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/coin-selection/</guid><description>Simulation-based evaluation of coin selection strategies

Introduction Thank you. ((applause))
Hi. Okay. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about coin selection. I have been doing this for my master thesis. To take you through what I will be talking about, I will be shortly outlining my work, then talking about coin selection in general. And then the design space of coin selection. I will also be introducing the framework I have been using for simulating coin selection.</description></item><item><title>Coin Selection</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/coin-selection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/coin-selection/</guid><description>Coin selection

Introduction I am going to do a short talk on coin selection. Everyone calls me kalle. In Japanese, my name is kalle. Coin selection, what it is, how it works, and interestingly enough- in the latest version of Bitcoin Core released yesterday, they have changed the coin selection algorithm for the first time since a long time. They are now using something with more scientific rigor behind it (branch-and-bound coin selection), which is good news.</description></item><item><title>Coinjoinxt</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/coinjoinxt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/coinjoinxt/</guid><description>CoinjoinXT and other techniques for deniable transfers.

I am going to talk about a pair of tools, one is a simulator and another one is a measurement station for the bitcoin network. So let me start with the bitcoin simulator framework. The easiest approach is to create a customized model that is a simplified abstraction of what you care about- which is like simbit, to show off how selfish-mining works. What you put in is what you get, so the model is actually different from the actual behavior of the bitcoin network means that you don&amp;rsquo;t learn anything really.</description></item><item><title>Collective Signing</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/collective-signing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/collective-signing/</guid><description>Enhancing bitcoin security and performance with strong consistency via collective signing

We are starting the session called &amp;ldquo;breaking the chain&amp;rdquo;. We will first have collective signing presentation. Thank you.
This is joint work with some collaborators.
What we have now is that real-time verification is not safe. What we managed to get is that we get transaction commitment in about 20-90 seconds at close to 1,000 transactions/second.</description></item><item><title>Comments And Observations About Timelocks Ron Rivest</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/verifiable-delay-functions/vdf-day-2019/comments-and-observations-about-timelocks-ron-rivest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/verifiable-delay-functions/vdf-day-2019/comments-and-observations-about-timelocks-ron-rivest/</guid><description>Comments and observations about timelocks and verifiable delay functions

Introduction Welcome everybody. It&amp;rsquo;s not only about solving the puzzles, but the immense interest in verifiable delay functions. When setting up this conference, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected that. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict where technology will go or what things will be popular decades later when you work on something.
I am just going to review some of the basic stuff we did way back when, setting up a puzzle which was just recently solved by Simon and Bernard where&amp;rsquo;s Bernard.</description></item><item><title>Compact Multi Signatures For Smaller Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/compact-multi-signatures-for-smaller-blockchains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/compact-multi-signatures-for-smaller-blockchains/</guid><description>Compact multi-signatures for smaller blockchains

Introduction Hi. Thanks a lot for coming in after lunch. This slot is often known as &amp;ldquo;the slot of death&amp;rdquo;. Some of us are jetlagged, this is the perfect time to doze off and only wake up at the end of the talk. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to prevent that from happening. I think the best way to do that is to start about what this talk can do for you.</description></item><item><title>Competitive Equilibria Staking Lending</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/competitive-equilibria-staking-lending/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/competitive-equilibria-staking-lending/</guid><description>Competitive equilibria between staking and on-chain lending

Introduction There have been some odd finanical attacks in the DeFi space and also on staking. This talk aims to show that the threat model for staking is definitively different from that of proof-of-work, and these financial attacks need to be part of the threat model.
Agenda I&amp;rsquo;ll go over some high level overview of intuitive market dynamics, then we will build up an agent-based model that correctly goes across multiple participants to stress test staking situations, then we go through the various assumptions, and at a high-level I&amp;rsquo;ll give some formal probability statements without proofs, and finally I have simulation results to discuss which can give you some idea about how to design a monetary policy.</description></item><item><title>Competitive Fee Market Urgency</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/competitive-fee-market-urgency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/competitive-fee-market-urgency/</guid><description>Marshall Long
The urgency of a competitive fee market to ensure a scalable future
I am Marshall. I run Firehash. CTO Cryptsy also. Some people have higher cost, some people have lower cost. I think those were some good estimates for true costs. I am going to be talking about why fees are going to be very important very soon. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what happens without fees, talk about why bitcoin really isn&amp;rsquo;t free but how we can do things like microtransactions, real microtransactions, talk about the cost and talk about solutions.</description></item><item><title>Concurrency And Privacy With Payment Channel Networks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/concurrency-and-privacy-with-payment-channel-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/concurrency-and-privacy-with-payment-channel-networks/</guid><description>Concurrency and Privacy with Payment-Channel Networks

paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/820.pdf
Introduction I am going to talk about concurrency and privacy. This was joint work with my collaborators.
Bitcoin has scalability issues. That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason why we are here today. Currently the bitcoin network allows for less than 10 transactions/second. Today we have more than 135 gigabytes of memory requirement. And there are some high fees and micropayments are not really possible.</description></item><item><title>Conner Fromknecht - Watchtowers (2019-04-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-conner-fromknecht-watchtowers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-conner-fromknecht-watchtowers/</guid><description>Conner Fromknecht

Welcome everyone to MIT Bitcoin Expo 2016. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of Bitcoin by now, then I am not sure how you got here. My name is nchinda. I am the reigning Bitcoin club president. I am going to have some fun. The club is hijacking the #mit-dci IRC channel. You can twitter with #mitbitcoinexpo.

We published this last February at an academic workshop. The work itself has interesting ramifications. My real goal here is to start a conversation and then do a follow-up blog post where we collate feedback from the community. We would like to add this to Bitcoin Core. Covenants.
This all started from a very basic and simple observation about the current status of our computing infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Cross Chain Deals And Adversarial Commerce</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/cross-chain-deals-and-adversarial-commerce/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/cross-chain-deals-and-adversarial-commerce/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;

Why bother? Just a high-level, why are we taking community resources to spend time on audits? There are some perspectives&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s good for the community and it&amp;rsquo;s what you do.
Bitcoin had on professional security audits and did just fine.

We have a full stack blockchain protocol and what I am going to talk about is part of that that also can be used for other applications including as I am going to demo here, make it easier to write scripts for Bitcoin Script.</description></item><item><title>Dandelion</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/dandelion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/dandelion/</guid><description>Dandelion: Privacy-preserving transaction propagation in bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s p2p network

Today I will be talking to you about privacy in bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s p2p layer. This was joint work with some talented colleagues.
Bitcoin p2p layer I want to give a brief overview of the p2p layer. Users in bitcoin are connected over a p2p network with tcp links. Users are identified by ip address and port number. Users have a second identity, which is their address or public key or however you want to think about it.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 Closing Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/day-1-closing-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/day-1-closing-panel/</guid><description>Closing panel

We need two to three minute report backs from each session. Also, note takers. Please email your notes to contact@scalingbitcoin.org so that we can add notes to the wiki. Come join us. Okay, so.
Lightning We discussed routing and several aspects of routing algorithms in the lightning network. We talked about the tradeoff between privacy aspects and reliability in routing. We quickly discovered that after some of the things were already resolved by the papers&amp;ndash; the way how we deal with a general separation and channel transaction fees, is actually quite an interesting discussion topic.</description></item><item><title>Day 2 Group Summaries</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/day-2-group-summaries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/day-2-group-summaries/</guid><description>Day 2 group summaries

Thank you Charlie, let&amp;rsquo;s have another round of applause. Up next, we have Andreas Antonopoulos.
So I may make this a bit difficult for the camera because I hate standing behind the podium. Welcome everyone. How are you, thank you for coming. How many people in this audience own Bitcoin?
So I usually start my question with that. And most audiences that gives me an accurate representation.

Introduction Thank you everyone. I am from the Israeli Bitcoin Association. I will start by describing the problem.
The problem The problem is variable transaction fees. The transaction fees shot up. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fluctuation. To understand why this is a problem, let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the basics.

First of all, a little bit about Bitpay. We were actually founded in May 2011. We have been around for some time. At the time, MtGox was actually still a viable exchange. The Bitcoin price was down at about $1 or a little more.

How often do you check your wallets? Have you ever looked in your wallet and found all your bitcoin gone or missing? Last summer, somebody, a friend of mine checked his wallet and found that 100,000 bitcoin was gone. What the hell, right? But that&amp;rsquo;s what happened at Bitfinex last summer. Some hacker got into their hot wallet and stole 100,000 bitcoin.

I will not be as technical as Olaoluwa was. You have nodes that open up payment channels. This scheme is actually developed at the moment in great detail. So how do you find the channels through which to send payments? So we wanted to propose some initial solution to this.

Thank you.
As you know, the blockchain is a chain because each block connects to the previous block through these hashes. In the header of each block is a commitment to all the transactions. It&amp;rsquo;s using this merkle hash tree where at each level the parent node hashes to the children and this gives you some nice properties which I will talk about later.</description></item><item><title>Fork Dynamics</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/fork-dynamics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/fork-dynamics/</guid><description>Fork dynamics

Introduction One of the most powerful things that you can do with SNARKs is something called recursive proofs where you actually prove that another SNARK was correct. I can give you a proof of a proof of a proof and this is amazing because you can prove an ever-expanding computation like a blockchain is always correct. I can always give you a proof that you have the latest block and you know the entire blockchain and all the transactions in it are correct.</description></item><item><title>Fraud Proofs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/fraud-proofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/fraud-proofs/</guid><description>Improving SPV client validation and security with fraud proofs

Introduction I am going to be talking about fraud proofs. It allows lite clients to have a leve lof security of almost the level of a full node. Before I describe fraud proofs, how about we talk about motivations.

In Bitcoin we have made this tradeoff where we don&amp;rsquo;t have everyone running full nodes. Not everyone is participating equally. If you have a full node, you have lots of gigs of hard drive space, but if you do that, you only get a few transactions per second. Modularizing validation an argument for this is how to improve on this situation.

Funding bitcoin development
It&amp;rsquo;s basically open-source funding. It&amp;rsquo;s a subset of open-source funding. But these are similar problems with many open-source projects. As far as I can tell, all these digital currency cryptocurrency projects are licensed with open-source licenses. There may be some that are not, and some things are patented. I generally steer clear of the patented work. If it&amp;rsquo;s decentralized and open-source, then why are you just delivering a binary to me?</description></item><item><title>Fungibility And Scalability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/fungibility-and-scalability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/fungibility-and-scalability/</guid><description>adam3us (Adam Back)

I think everyone knows what fungibility is, it&amp;rsquo;s when coins are equal and interchangeable. It&amp;rsquo;s an important property for an electronic cash system. All bitcoin users would have a problem if fungability goes away.
Bitcoin has fungibility without privacy. Previous electronic cash systems had fungibility and cryptographic blinding. In Bitcoin, there&amp;rsquo;s decentralized mining that somebody will process your transaction even if a given miner may not.</description></item><item><title>Fungibility Overview</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/fungibility-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/fungibility-overview/</guid><description>Fungibility overview

https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/784676022318952448
Introduction Alright. So let&amp;rsquo;s get started. Okay. Why fungibility? Let&amp;rsquo;s start. What does fungibility mean? Bitcoin is like cash. The hope is that it&amp;rsquo;s for immediate and final payments. To add some nuiance there, you might have to wait for some confirmations. Once you receive a bitcoin, you have a bitcoin and that&amp;rsquo;s final. So even with banks and PayPal, who sometimes shutdown accounts for trivial reasons or sometimes no reason at all, it&amp;rsquo;s typically not the case that it&amp;rsquo;s someone who sent you money&amp;hellip; if you were selling something on ebay, and someone bought an item from you, and that person had an account shutdown, the money you received will not be removed from your account.</description></item><item><title>Future Of Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-blockchains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/future-of-blockchains/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

The reason why I like this protocol is because it&amp;rsquo;s a very simple generalization of the longest-chain protocol that we all know and love.

Introduction Handle is a aggregation protocol for large scale byzantine committees. This is work with my colleagues in addition to myself.
Why aggregate? Distributed systems often require gathering statements about large subsets of nodes. However, processing (filtering, aggregating&amp;hellip;) measurements can be a bottleneck. We want to apply some processing while collecting the measurements.
Why byzantine? A byzantine node is a node that can be arbitrary.</description></item><item><title>Hardening Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/hardening-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/hardening-lightning/</guid><description>Hardening lightning network

Today I am going to be talking about bitcoin full nodes. Can everyone hear me? Okay, great. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually think there&amp;rsquo;s a specific number. I think a lot of people do. They look for a number. 5000 is about how many we have today, 6000. Some people ask whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good number. I think that&amp;rsquo;s the wrong way to look at the role of full nodes in the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Improving Bitcoin Smart Contract Efficiency</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2018/improving-bitcoin-smart-contract-efficiency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2018/improving-bitcoin-smart-contract-efficiency/</guid><description>Improving efficiency of smart contracts on the bitcoin network

That was a very useful talk (on security assumptions), thank you Andrew.
I am going to start by talking about nitty-gritty applications where adversarial thinking is useful for incentives for decentralization. In an environment where everyone has the data, we are kind of limited as to what we can do. When we talk about scale, I am talking about 5 or 10 orders of magnitude. Do we have a system that has fundamentally different scaling characteristics?</description></item><item><title>Incentives Tradeoffs Transaction Selection In Dag Based Protocols</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/incentives-tradeoffs-transaction-selection-in-dag-based-protocols/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/incentives-tradeoffs-transaction-selection-in-dag-based-protocols/</guid><description>Incentives and Trade-offs in Transaction Selection in DAG-based Protocols

Commercial effort to implement DAG-based protocols. No ICO, it&amp;rsquo;s a regular company.
A little bit background of DAG-based protocols. The background to this work is something we have been working at Hebrew University and Yoad. This idea of blockDAG is about layer 1 of bitcoin. And so it&amp;rsquo;s a generalization of the chain structure of blockchain. As such, there are two solutions- lightning network and payment channels, and were scaling up layer 1, and you&amp;rsquo;re scaling up in layer 2, it&amp;rsquo;s complementary solutions.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing Payment Channel Watchtowers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/incentivizing-payment-channel-watchtowers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/incentivizing-payment-channel-watchtowers/</guid><description>Incentivizing payment channel watchtowers

Introduction Hi. Good morning. I am Zeta. I am going to talk about how to incentivize payment channel watchtowers. This is joint work with my collaborators.
Micropayment channels There are many ways to construct channels such as lightning channels and duplex channels. There&amp;rsquo;s hops, you can route payments, and other proposals more recent ones for doing channels in payment networks like sprites, eltoo, all of them although they are different they all share the fundamental nature of channels.</description></item><item><title>Internal Approaches Blockchain Database Technology Strategies</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/internal-approaches-blockchain-database-technology-strategies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/internal-approaches-blockchain-database-technology-strategies/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

JW: Matthew Bishop&amp;rsquo;s panel yesterday divided the universe into three broad categories. This seems to be the way these things work out. You get the newcomer who realy gets it right and gets very big. Then you get in the case particuarly, which is what wer&amp;rsquo;e talking about right here, which is the financia srevices industry, you get the incumbents or the people who are already doing business who realize there needs to be a change.</description></item><item><title>Internet Of Value</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/internet-of-value/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/internet-of-value/</guid><description>Jeremy Allaire
What are the lessons from the development of the internet that we can learn from? Why is there an inevitability as to what Bitcoin is doing?
At a high level, I like to explain that we are experiencing a fundamental transformation in how the world economy stores and verifies value. Bitcoin and these other projects that are being built are part of that arc.

Thank you all for coming. We have some bitcoin contributors here, and some people from the investment community. The impetus for this event was a bitcoin conference this weekend, but also Gideon is speaking today. We went to a blockchain event a few months ago and it was our impression that they didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job of explaining bitcoin to investors. Since we&amp;rsquo;re all up here in Dallas, we thought we would share some perspectives about what bitcoin is and how it works for people that are actively contributing in the space.</description></item><item><title>Intro</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/intro/</guid><description>Intro

Welcome to scaling bitcoin. This is an international conference. We run the event every year in a different geographical location. We run this event as a strictly academic and engineering conference. The mentality that we take behind the event is think global, act local. It&amp;rsquo;s a well known bitcoin additive. Our goal is to stimulate the bitcoin ecosystem. The best way to do this is to stimulate the engineering community, because that&amp;rsquo;s what drives this magnificent technology for the last almost 10 years now.</description></item><item><title>Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables And Weak Block Propagation Performance</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/invertible-bloom-lookup-tables-and-weak-block-propagation-performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/invertible-bloom-lookup-tables-and-weak-block-propagation-performance/</guid><description>IBLT and weak block propagation performance

Jeff Garzik (jgarzik)
Bitcoin was introduced as a p2p electronic cash system. That&amp;rsquo;s what it says in the whitepaper. That&amp;rsquo;s what the users were exposed to. The 1 MB block size was set for anti-spam purposes. Otherwise when bitcoin value is low, it&amp;rsquo;s trivial to DOS the network with large blocks.
Moving on to some observations. The process of finding distributed ocnsensus takes time; it&amp;rsquo;s a settlement system.</description></item><item><title>Jeremy Rubin - Covenants (2017-01-26)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/2017-01-26-jeremy-rubin-covenants/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/2017-01-26-jeremy-rubin-covenants/</guid><description>Name: Jeremy Rubin

Finding a risk-free rate for Bitcoin
Joinmarket, just to clear up a misconception&amp;hellip; Joinmarket, like bitcoin, it is a protocol. Not a company. The protocol is defined by an open-source reference implementation. There are other versions of the code out there. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely, I guess you could say it&amp;rsquo;s voluntary like bitcoin.

Introduction Okay, hello. My name is David Vorick. I have been with bitcoin since 2011. I have been a full-time blockchain engineer since about 2014. I run an altcoin for decentralized cloud storage called Sia. Today I am going to be talking about braiding which basically means we take the straight line blockchain of bitcoin and we allow blocks to have multiple parents.</description></item><item><title>Kalle Alm - Signet Integration (2020-02-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-kalle-alm-signet-integration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-kalle-alm-signet-integration/</guid><description>Name: Karl-Johan Alm

I&amp;rsquo;ll be the contrarian - I think academia is awful and should be destroyed.
Reputation is completely independent of content and should not be the mechanism by which you judge the quality of research; your reputation is worthless to me. (laughter)

Mimblewimble pros and cons There are no amounts, no addresses, and improved scaling. But one of hte problems is that it requires interactive transactions. But this is a pro because of this you have to participate in mining. You can send money to addresses without having to accept the money. Just as you saw here, you can identify the blue box as an output or an input. You could build up a transaction graph.</description></item><item><title>Lessons For Bitcoin From 150 Years Of Decentralization</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/lessons-for-bitcoin-from-150-years-of-decentralization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/lessons-for-bitcoin-from-150-years-of-decentralization/</guid><description>Lessons for Bitcoin from the 150-year History of Decentralization

This is me. When I first suggested giving a talk here on libbitcoin, &amp;hellip;. one of the pieces of feedback I got was that bitcoin is libbitcoin, what are you building on bitcoin? libbitcoin is actually more. I will also talk about what it is going on underneath. It&amp;rsquo;s an implementation of bitcoin as well.
Most of the talks I give are around cryptoeconomics.</description></item><item><title>Libbitcoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/libbitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/libbitcoin/</guid><description>Libbitcoin: A practical introduction

It is similar to the internet, but it is not the internet. How do you find such a route? It&amp;rsquo;s easy when you find all the implements of the network.

We have been looking at this for a while at NASDAQ.</description></item><item><title>Ln Present And Future Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/ln-present-and-future-panel/</guid><description>Lightning network present &amp;amp; future panel

Introduction Okay, thank you. The title of my talk is exploring the limits of plasma. This is joint work with others.
Plasma Let me start by telling you about Plasma. It&amp;rsquo;s a family of layer 2 solutions for scaling blockchain. It was proposed in 2017 by Poon and Buterin. It&amp;rsquo;s a family of protocols. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of different plasmas.</description></item><item><title>Maaku Panel</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/maaku-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/maaku-panel/</guid><description>This can be a broad range of topics for improvements.

We are 25 minutes behind schedule.
We have the rest of the team wathcing remotely. I think the motivation for this project is clear. Transaction volume on the bitcoin network could be growing exponentially except that there is a limit on the number of confirmed transactions. Transaction fees have increased and confirmation times are not reliable, and bitcoin is unusable for some applications.</description></item><item><title>Mechanism Design</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/mechanism-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/mechanism-design/</guid><description>&amp;ndash; Disclaimer &amp;ndash;

Introduction Fun fact: I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone knows this fact, but antpool is a miner and antpool is not mining replace-by-fee transactions. What I mean by that is that if you do a replace-by-fee transaction, they will ignore the second high fee transaction. There are cases where transactions are RBF-bumped to increase the fee to make it mined faster, so you RBF bump it, and then you have people spending the unconfirmed RBF version and then have a chain of transactions but then the original transaction is mined and not the other chained transactions.</description></item><item><title>Metadata</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/metadata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/metadata/</guid><description>https://bitcoinedge.org/slack</description></item><item><title>Microchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/microchains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/microchains/</guid><description>Microchains

LN transactions are real Bitcoin transactions. These are real zero-confirmation transactions. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that the original idea behind Bitcoin was solving the double-spending problem. When you move off-chain and off-block, you sort of have this opposite situation where you use double-spends to your advantage, spending from the same output, except you have this global consensus of block but you have this local ordering that you use through this lightning system of penalties through which you can update the balances between two people.</description></item><item><title>Neutrino</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/neutrino/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/neutrino/</guid><description>Neutrino bip158

Harry Kalodner
I am from Princeton University. I am here to talk about the scalability issues that non-currency applications of bitcoin have that might be a little different than regular payments that go through the bitcoin network. I put this together with my advisor, Arvind. The reason why I want to talk about this is because when people talk about how bitcoin will have to scale is that people throw out a thing about Visa processing 20,000 transactions per second or something.</description></item><item><title>Omniledger</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/omniledger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/omniledger/</guid><description>Omniledger: A secure, scale-out, decentralized ledger via sharding

As most of you might know, in bitcoin and blockchains, the information is very important. Every node should receive the blocks in the network. Increase latency and risk network partition. If individual peers do not get the information, they could be victims of selfish mining and so on. Multiple blockchains has been proposed, multiple reparameterizations like litecoin, dogecoin, ethereum and others.</description></item><item><title>Onion Routing In Lightning</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/onion-routing-in-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/onion-routing-in-lightning/</guid><description>Onion routing in lightning network

Privacy-preserving decentralized micropayments
We&amp;rsquo;re excited about lightning because the second layer could be an important opportunity to improve privacy and fungibility. Also, there might be timing information in the payments themselves.
Distributed set of onion routers (OR, cite OG onionrouting paper). Users create circuits with sub-set of nodes. Difficult for oion routers to gain more info than predecessor+successor in path.</description></item><item><title>Opening</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/opening/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/opening/</guid><description>Opening remarks for Baltic Honeybadger 2018

Introduction Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get started our afternoon session. Our first talk I am very happy to introduce our speaker on optimistic virtual machines. Earlier in this conference we heard about optimistic roll-ups and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this talk on optimistic virtual machines which is an up-and-coming approach on doing this.
Why hello everyone.

I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to introduce the idea of zero-confirmation transactions and lightning. We have given talks about this. There&amp;rsquo;s some documentation available. There&amp;rsquo;s an implementation being worked on. I think it helps a lot with scalability by keeping some transactions off the blockchain. Ideally, many or most transactions. Instead, you would open and close channels.</description></item><item><title>Overview Of Security Concerns</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/overview-of-security-concerns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/overview-of-security-concerns/</guid><description>petertodd
Overview of Security Concerns
I am going to talk about scale-related security issues. Scale-related security issues. I said scale, not scalability. We are not talking about scalability. We&amp;rsquo;re talking about changing numbers, and what are the implications, what attacks are easier or harder by changing the block size number. What are we trying to accomplish? What is the system meant to be? Nobody really agrees of course. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that as much as we disagree about what was meant to be, there are a lot of key things about what bitcoin could be, these visions share some details.</description></item><item><title>P2P Encryption</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/p2p-encryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/p2p-encryption/</guid><description>bip324: v2 message transport protocol

Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network John: So far today, we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about transactions and blocks and the blockchain. Those are the fundamental building blocks of Bitcoin. Those are the data structures that we use. On a more practical level, how does a Bitcoin network actually function? How do we transmit these transactions and blocks around?</description></item><item><title>P2Pkh P2Wpkh P2H P2Wsh</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/p2pkh-p2wpkh-p2h-p2wsh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/p2pkh-p2wpkh-p2h-p2wsh/</guid><description>P2PKH/P2WPKH/P2H/P2WSH

Introduction This is going to be a bit of a re-tread I think. I am going to be talking about common bitcoin script templates used in bitcoin today.
Addresses do not exist on the blockchain. But scripts do. You&amp;rsquo;ve heard about p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh, and others. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over these anyway.
Pay-to-pubkey (p2pk) This was the first type. It had no address format actually.</description></item><item><title>Pairing Cryptography</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/pairing-cryptography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/pairing-cryptography/</guid><description>Dan Boneh (see also 1)

Introduction Bryan briefly mentioned partially-signed bitcoin transactions (PSBT). I can give more depth on this. There&amp;rsquo;s history and motivation, a background of why this is important, what these things are doing. What is the software doing?
History and motivation Historically, there was no standard for this. Armory had its own format. Bitcoin Core had network-serialized transactions. This ensures fragmentation and it&amp;rsquo;s incomplete and bad that there was no standard.</description></item><item><title>Payment Channel Recovery With Seeds</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/payment-channel-recovery-with-seeds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/payment-channel-recovery-with-seeds/</guid><description>Seed-based payment channel recovery

Introduction Cool. This addresses the lightning network which is a scaling technique for the bitcoin network. A big challenge with the lightning network is that you have these midstates that you need to keep. If you lose them, you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck with your counterparty. We had a lot of talks this morning about how to recover midstates but a lot of them used watchtowers.</description></item><item><title>Peter R</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/peter-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/peter-r/</guid><description>((Note that there is a more accurate transcript from Peter-R himself below.))
Miners have another job as well. Miners are commodity producers, they produce something that the world has never seen. They produce block space, which is room for transactional debt. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what the field of economics tells us. We&amp;rsquo;ll plot the total number of bytes per block. On the vertical we will plot the unit cost of the commodity, or the price of 1 transaction worth of blockspace.</description></item><item><title>Peter Todd Scalability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/peter-todd-scalability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/peter-todd-scalability/</guid><description>Peter Todd
Scalability
There we go. Yeah. Looks good. Thank you.
So I wanted to talk about scalability and I wanted to give two opposing views of it. The first is really, scaling Bitcoin up is really really easy. The underlying architecture of Bitcoin is designed in a way that makes it easy to scale. You have your blockchain, and you have your blocks at the top which are 80 bytes data structures.</description></item><item><title>Pindar Wong</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/pindar-wong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/pindar-wong/</guid><description>Pindar Wong

Introduction Prism is a consensus protocol which is a one-stop solution to all of bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s scaling problems. The title is 7 to 70000 transactions per second. We have a full stack implementation of prism running and we were able to obtain 70,000 transactions/second. Before we get started, here are my collaborators.

Even though Bitcoin is the worst privacy system ever, everyone in the community very strongly values privacy.
There are at least three things: privacy censorship resistance fungibility
The easiest way to censor things is to punish communication, not prevent communication. Privacy is the weakest link in censorship resistance. Fungibility is an absolute necessity for any medium of exchange. The properties of money include fungibility. Without privacy you may not be able to have fungibility.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Concepts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/privacy-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/privacy-concepts/</guid><description>Privacy concepts for bitcoin application developers

Introduction You&amp;rsquo;re not going to walk out of here as a privacy protocol developer. I am going to mention and talk about some ideas in some protocols that exist. What I find myself is that of really smart people working on a lot of pretty cool stuff that can make privacy easier and better to use. A lot of times, application developers or exchanges aren&amp;rsquo;t even aware of those things and as a result the end result is that people just sometimes use bitcoin in very non-private ways because they&amp;rsquo;re not aware of how to do privacy.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preserving Multi Hop Locks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/privacy-preserving-multi-hop-locks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/privacy-preserving-multi-hop-locks/</guid><description>Privacy preserving multi-hop locks for blockchain scalability and interoperability

Introduction This is joint work with my collaborators. Permissionless blockchains have some issues. The permissionless nature leads to the transaction rate that they have. This limits widespread adoption of blockchain technology like bitcoin or ethereum. Scalability approaches can be roughly grouped into two groups, one is on-chain layer 1 solutions. The other group is off-chain layer 2, which is the focus of this talk today.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preserving Smart Contracts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/privacy-preserving-smart-contracts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/privacy-preserving-smart-contracts/</guid><description>Ranjit Kumaresan

We have been looking at how much we can support or what limitations we might encounter. There are also efficiency issues and privacy guarantees. And then there are some potential relaxations that will help with removing the fundamental limitations and express the power and make smart contracts more useful.
The point of this talk is off-chain transactions and secure computation. I will also highlight the relationship of secure computation and bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Private Information Retrieval</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/private-information-retrieval/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/private-information-retrieval/</guid><description>Applying private information retrieval (PIR) to lightweight bitcoin clients
SPV overview I have to thank the prior speaker. This is basically the same, except this time we&amp;rsquo;re not using SGX. We&amp;rsquo;re looking at bitcoin lightweight clients. You have a lite client with not much space not much computing power, can&amp;rsquo;t store the bitcoin blockchain. All it knows about is the header information. We assume it has the blockheader history. In the header, we can find the merkle tree, and given the merkle tree we can make a merkle proof that a given transaction is included in a block.</description></item><item><title>Proof Of Necessary Work</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/proof-of-necessary-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/proof-of-necessary-work/</guid><description>Proof of necessary work: Succinct state verification with fairness guarantees

Introduction I am going to show you proof of necessary work today. We use proof of work in a prototype. This is joint work with my collaborators.
Problems We wanted to tackle the problem of bitcoin blockchain size increases. Every 10 minutes, a block is added to the blockchain and the blockchain grows linearly in size over time. Initial block download increases over time.</description></item><item><title>Proof Of Necessary Work</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-necessary-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-necessary-work/</guid><description>Proof of Necessary Work: Succinct State Verification with Fairness Guarantees

Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s start with something familiar. When you have a new lite client, or any client that wants to trustlessly connect to the network and joins the network for the first time&amp;hellip; they see this: they need to download a lot of data, initially, and then on an ongoing basis. They need to do a lot of verification and computation on top of this data.</description></item><item><title>Proof Of Stake</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-stake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-stake/</guid><description>Proof-of-stake longest chain protocols revisited

History lesson In the 90s, we had some timestamping schemes where things are aggregated into one hash and then it would be publicized later in the newspaper. This scheme was commercialized, in fact. However, the resolution of the trust anchor is very limited. It&amp;rsquo;s one day or half-day at best.</description></item><item><title>Proofs Of Space</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/proofs-of-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/proofs-of-space/</guid><description>Beyond Hellman&amp;rsquo;s time-memory trade-offs with applications to proofs of space

Introduction This talk is about proofs of space and tight proofs of space.
Proof of Space A proof-of-space is an alternative to proof-of-work. Applications have been proposed like spam prevention, DoS attack prevention, sybil resistance in consensus networks which is most relevant to this conference. In proof-of-space, it&amp;rsquo;s an interactive protocol between a miner and a prover who has some disk storage and claims that hey I am storing 1 gigabyte of data.</description></item><item><title>Protecting Yourself And Your Business</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/protecting-yourself-and-your-business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/protecting-yourself-and-your-business/</guid><description>Exchange security: Protecting yourself and your business

R3
Kathleen Breitman
I work at R3. It manages the distributed ledger group, of 42 banks interested in using blockchain or distributed ledger tech. People wonder when I tell them that I work for a consortium that wants to use electronic ledgers. What does that have to do with capital markets?
Ledgers can track transactions. Typically in a capital market context, this responsibility falls to the backoffice. After a trade, you finalize it and actually transfer value.</description></item><item><title>Reaching Consensus Open Blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/reaching-consensus-open-blockchains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/reaching-consensus-open-blockchains/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

Introduction This talk is going to be about rebalancing in the lightning network. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the implications and about running a lightning node.
Financial costs In the lightning network, routing nodes will incur in financial costs by having their money locked inside channels. They can&amp;rsquo;t use that money elsewhere. They incur a financial cost to doing this activity, at least an opportunity cost.</description></item><item><title>Rebroadcasting</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/rebroadcasting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/rebroadcasting/</guid><description>Rebroadcasting

A lot of people were reducing their security model by not validating their bitcoin. It was potentially less secure. That&amp;rsquo;s not something that relay networks try to address. The big issue with the decreasing number of nodes, which the relay network doesn&amp;rsquo;t address, is that it reduces the resilience against attack. If there&amp;rsquo;s only 100 nodes, there&amp;rsquo;s really only some 100 VPses that you have to knock offline before the bitcoin network stops working.</description></item><item><title>Reorgs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/reorgs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/reorgs/</guid><description>Bryan Bishop

Introduction Thanks for the introduction, Jameson. I feel like a rock star now. So yeah, I won&amp;rsquo;t introduce myself. I call myself a code monkey the reason is that a lot of the talks in scaling bitcoin can surprise people but I understood very few of them. The reason is that I am more of an application developer.

I have been working on some software for the past few weeks to talk about working things rather than theory. The presentation is going to suffer because of this.
Bitcoin Core has a networking stack that dates back all the way to the initial implementation from Satoshi or at least it&amp;rsquo;s been patched and hacked on ever since.</description></item><item><title>Rodolfo Novak Coldcard Mk3 (2019-09-14)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2019/2019-09-14-rodolfo-novak-coldcard-mk3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2019/2019-09-14-rodolfo-novak-coldcard-mk3/</guid><description>Name: Rodolfo Novak

Future of SPV Technology Bram Cohen
So hopefully I summarized this reasonably. There were a number of things that came up in our discussion. It would help SPV a lot if there were UTXO commitments in blocks. This can be done with a soft-fork. It has implementation cost difficulties. There are some ugly things you could do about how the trees are formed, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to repopulate the whole thing every single block.</description></item><item><title>Roundgroup Roundup 2</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/roundgroup-roundup-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/roundgroup-roundup-2/</guid><description>Roundgroup roundup day 2

Intro So Simplicity is a programming language that I have been working on at Blockstream. I call it an alternative or reimagination of Bitcoin Script as it would have been if I had invented Bitcoin. An alternative or new instruction set that is compatible with Bitcoin. It could be soft forked in.</description></item><item><title>Rusty Russell - JSON Interface (2019-04-06)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-rusty-russell-json-interface/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/boltathon/2019-04-06-rusty-russell-json-interface/</guid><description>Rusty Russell

Intro Ok I have top running. We have a plan and we’re going to start from zero. We’re going to clone c-lightning, we’re going to compile it, we’re going to set up a test node. I’m assuming Bitcoin is already installed. We’re going to talk a little about configuring it and stuff like that.

Introduction Groups of unknown order are interesting cryptographic primitives. You can commit to integers. If you commit to a very large integer, you have to do a lot of work to do the commitment so you have a sequentiality assumption useful for VDFs. But then you have this compression property where if you take a large integer with a lot of information in it, you can compress it down to something small.</description></item><item><title>Scalable Smart Contracts Via Proofs And Single Use Seals</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/scalable-smart-contracts-via-proofs-and-single-use-seals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2017/scalable-smart-contracts-via-proofs-and-single-use-seals/</guid><description>Scalable smart contracts via proofs and single-use seals

Thank you. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit the last one was probably the most fun other than. On the schedule, it said scaling and UTXO and I threw something together. TXO commitments were a bold idea but recently there were some observations that make it more interesting. I thought I would start by going through what problem they are actually solving.
Like David was saying in the last presentation, running a full node is kind of a pain.</description></item><item><title>Scaling Debate Is A Proxy Battle Over Centralization</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/scaling-debate-is-a-proxy-battle-over-centralization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/scaling-debate-is-a-proxy-battle-over-centralization/</guid><description>James D&amp;rsquo;Angelo

Lotteries Imagine a trusted party who conducts lotteries between Alice and Bob. The goal of the lottery protocol is to use a cryptographic protocol without having a lottery trusted party.</description></item><item><title>Scriptless Scripts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/scriptless-scripts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/scriptless-scripts/</guid><description>Scriptless scripts

Introduction I know this is the last formal talk of the day so thank you so much for being here. This is joint work with my collaborators.
Is storage really an issue for bitcoin? Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s blockchain size is only 238 GB. So why is storage important? But blockchain size is a growing problem. It&amp;rsquo;s always going to go up.</description></item><item><title>Secure Protocols Bip Taproot</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/secure-protocols-bip-taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/secure-protocols-bip-taproot/</guid><description>Secure protocols on BIP-taproot

Hi, welcome back.
I am a developer for libsecp256k1. It&amp;rsquo;s a library that does the underlying traditional cryptography used in Bitcoin. I am going to talk about security assumptions, security models and trust models. I am going to give a high-level overview of how we should be thinking about these issues for scaling and efficiency and decentralization. Bitcoin is a crypto system.

Introduction Hi, I am Alexei. I am a research student at Imperial College London and I will be talking about the security of decentralized mining pools.
Motivation The motivation behind this talk is straightforward. I think we can all agree that to some extent the hashrate in bitcoin has seen some centralization around large mining pools, which undermines the base properties of censorship resistance in bitcoin which I think bitcoin solves in a nice matter.</description></item><item><title>Security Of Diminishing Block Subsidy</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/security-of-diminishing-block-subsidy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/security-of-diminishing-block-subsidy/</guid><description>Miles Carlsten

Miners no longer incentivized to mine all the time. The future of mining hardware. Impact on the bitcoin ecosystem. Implications and assumptions of the model.
Are minting rewards and transaction fees the same? Transaction fees are time-dependent. A miner can only claim transaction fees as transactions are added to their block. As transaction fees start to dominate the block reward, they become time-dependent. We are modeling this block reward as a linear function of time, we have this factor B which might be initial minting reward, and we have some scaling factor, the block reward is like &amp;ldquo;b + at&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Segregated Witness And Its Impact On Scalability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/segregated-witness-and-its-impact-on-scalability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/segregated-witness-and-its-impact-on-scalability/</guid><description>Pieter Wuille (sipa)

Vlad Zamfir
I am going to talk about blockchain sharding. This is one of the scaling solutions that I like the most. I have done the most work on it. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know who I am, I am a researcher mostly with the ethereum project. Basically the basics of sharding is that in non-sharding, every node does every validation. In a sharding solution, nodes hold a subset of the state, and a subset of the blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Siacoin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/siacoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/siacoin/</guid><description>Sia

Before we begin, we will explain how the workshops will work upstairs. There will be some topics and room numbers. Now we will start the next presentation on sidechain scaling with Paul Sztorc. Thank you everyone.
Thanks a lot. So this talk will be a little different. Scaling via strategy, not physics. This will not change the kilobytes sent over&amp;ndash; it will, just not in the literal sense.</description></item><item><title>Sidechains And Federation Models</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/sidechains-and-federation-models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/sidechains-and-federation-models/</guid><description>Sidechains and federation models

Introduction The name &amp;ldquo;sidechain&amp;rdquo; is overloaded. My favorite private sidechain is my coach. That&amp;rsquo;s my private sidechain. Hopefully I can explain the high-level concepts of a sidechain, at a 10,000 foot view. What are these? What do they give you?
Sidechain components First you need a blockchain. It has to be something that builds a consensus history. The state of the ledger has to be recorded, or the account model, or whatever you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description></item><item><title>Sighash Noinput</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/sighash-noinput/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/sighash-noinput/</guid><description>Bryan Bishop

Hi, my name is Bryan, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about SIGHASH NOINPUT. It was something that I was asked to speak about. It is currently not deployed, but it is an active proposal.
So, just really brief about who I am. I have a software development background. I just left LedgerX last week, so that is an exciting change in my life.</description></item><item><title>Signet</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/signet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/signet/</guid><description>Signet

Introduction I was going to talk about signet yesterday but people had some delay downloading docker images. How many of you have signet right now? How many think you have signet right now? How many downloaded something yesterday? How many docker users? And how many people have compiled it themselves? Okay. I think we have like 10 people. The people that compiled it yourself, I think you&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to do this.</description></item><item><title>Single Use Seals</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/single-use-seals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/building-on-bitcoin/2018/single-use-seals/</guid><description>Single use seals

Introduction It always seems like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of different proof systems, but it turns out they really work well together and there&amp;rsquo;s great abstractions that are happening where we can take different tools and plug them together. We will see some of those in this session. I think STARKs were first announced 3 years ago back when this conference was BPASE, and now they are ready to use for developers and they are deployed in the wild and it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to see how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come in the past few years.</description></item><item><title>State Channels</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/state-channels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/state-channels/</guid><description>State channels as a scaling solution for cryptocurrencies

Introduction I am an assistant professor at King&amp;rsquo;s College London. There are many collaborators on this project. Also IC3. Who here has heard of state channels before? Okay, about half of the audience. Let me remove some misconceptions around them.
Scalability problems in bitcoin Why are state channels necessary for cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies do not scale. Bitcoin supports 10 transactions/second, ethereum is 12 transactions/second sort of depending on how big your transaction is going to be.</description></item><item><title>State Of Blockchain</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/state-of-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/state-of-blockchain/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

Signatures and zero-knowledge proofs
Benedikt Bunz, Stanford University
Am going to talk about cryptography relevant to blockchains. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about signatures and zero-knowledge proofs. It has a lot of applications to bitcoin. It turns out that bitcoin is pretty simple in terms of cryptography. It just uses a hash function (sha256) and,s eparately, ECDSA for signatures. I will be mentioning some other cryptography that bitcoin could use.</description></item><item><title>State Of Lightning Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/state-of-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/state-of-lightning-network/</guid><description>Fireside chat on the state of the lightning network

Introduction I am going to be talking about the state of multisig. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of creating a transaction output that requires multiple keys to sign. This is a focus for people holding bitcoin. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about some of the benefits and some of the issues. I am not a security expert, though.

Introduction If you want to know the details of statechains, I recommend checking out my talk from Breaking Bitcoin 2019 Amsterdam. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a quick recap of Schnorr signatures and adaptor signatures and then statechains. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand Schnorr signatures to the point where you&amp;rsquo;re really comfortable with it.

Statechains This is another layer 2 scaling solution, by avoiding on-chain transactions. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to lightning network. The difference is that coin movement is not restricted. You deon&amp;rsquo;t have these channels where you have to have a path and send an exact amount.</description></item><item><title>Streamlet</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/streamlet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/streamlet/</guid><description>Streamlet: Textbook Streamlined Blockchain Protocols

Jarl Fransson (Strawpay)
7 transactions per second, or is it 3? That&amp;rsquo;s about what we can do with bitcoin. What if you need 100,000 transactions per second? I come from Strawpay, we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into bitcoin for a long time. When we learned about scripting and the power of contracts, like payment channels, we thought maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to do micropayments and microtransactions. To give you some perspective on scale, let&amp;rsquo;s say that 1 billion people make 25 transactions per day.</description></item><item><title>Submarine Swaps</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/submarine-swaps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/submarine-swaps/</guid><description>Bridging off-chain and on-chain with submarine swaps

Introduction Hi everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s too bad that we can&amp;rsquo;t be in person but I think by next year we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do this in person. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long year without conferences. And I guess for maybe many people watching the MIT Bitcoin Expo last March, was the last time I saw a bunch of people in person before this whole thing.</description></item><item><title>Taproot</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/taproot/</guid><description>Building Taproot

https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1047764770265284608
Introduction Taproot and graftroot are recent proposals in the bitcoin world. Every script type looks different and they are distinct. From a privacy perspective, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty bad. You watermark or fingerprint yourself all the time by showing unique scripts on the blockchain or in your transactions. This causes censorship risks and other problems for fungibility. Often you are paying for contigencies that are never used, like the whoopsies branches in your scripts.</description></item><item><title>Taproot Schnorr Soft Fork</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bit-block-boom/2019/taproot-schnorr-soft-fork/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bit-block-boom/2019/taproot-schnorr-soft-fork/</guid><description>Taproot, Schnorr, and the next soft-fork

Bitcoin mining
Bitcoin has been one of the most interesting rides of my life. I come from an oil/gas family. I lived in Midland after college. I became very interested in monetary policy, inflation and its effects on the world. Through that, really discovered bitcoin and what it is capable of doing. I come from the energy perspective and Austrian school of economics.

I think most people here have some idea of who I am. I am a long-term bitcoiner. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in bitcoin since 2010. I love bitcoin. I am passionate about it. I want to see it grow and prosper. The positive thing about bitcoin is that it has a resilient ecosystem. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any CEO. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any centralized organization and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any central point to direct where it is going.</description></item><item><title>The Bitcoin Standard</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-bitcoin-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/the-bitcoin-standard/</guid><description>The bitcoin standard as a layered scaling solution

Scriptless scripts We can write smart contracts in bitcoin today, but there&amp;rsquo;s some limitations. We can do a lot of great things. We can do atomic swaps, multisig, payment channels, etc. There&amp;rsquo;s a cost, though. Transactions become bigger with bigger scripts. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of heavy on the verifiers. The verifiers now need to verify more things. There&amp;rsquo;s also privacy issues because you put your contract publicly on chain.</description></item><item><title>Threshold Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/threshold-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/threshold-signatures/</guid><description>Efficient distributed key generation for threshold signatures
Mahnush Movahedi
Threshold signatures Threshold signature schemes are schemes where n parties and at least t are necessary and sufficient for signing. They want to make sure that t parties are necessary. Any threshold signature scheme typically has 3 protocols: key generation, signing, and verifying.
In key generation, one party creates a group public key as an output. Also, for each node that participates in the protocol, the protocol should output a secret key.</description></item><item><title>Thundercore</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</guid><description>Thundercore consensus

Introduction Synchronous with a chance of partition tolerance. Thank you for inviting me. I am going to be talking about some new updates. It&amp;rsquo;s joint work with my collaborators. The problem is state-machine replication, sometimes called blockchain or consensus. These terms are going to be the same thing in this talk. The nodes are trying to agree on a linearly updated transaction log.
State-machine replication We care about consistency and liveness.</description></item><item><title>Tim Ruffing - MuSig2 (2021-01-12)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/realworldcrypto/2021/2021-01-12-tim-ruffing-musig2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/realworldcrypto/2021/2021-01-12-tim-ruffing-musig2/</guid><description>Name: Tim Ruffing

Hi everybody. I attended Montreal and Hong Kong. It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasurable to be here in Milan giving a talk about scaling bitcoin. I am going to be talking about scalable and accountable timestamping. Why timestamping at this conference? Then I will talk about aggregating timestamps.

How wallets can handle real transaction fees
You should have a market at this point, where some number of transactions never happen because they aren&amp;rsquo;t willing to pay a fee. So you get some equilibrium of price going on.

They provide set anonymity when used as a classic tumbler. They are untrusted. The tumbler can&amp;rsquo;t violate your privacy, and can&amp;rsquo;t steal your coins. It&amp;rsquo;s also scalable. It&amp;rsquo;s compatible and works with today&amp;rsquo;s bitcoin. There are no malleability concerns. We&amp;rsquo;re going to rely on the constrained opcodes that currently exist in bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Txprobe</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/txprobe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/txprobe/</guid><description>TxProbe: Discovering bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s network topology using orphan transactions

Introduction I am Sergi. I will be presenting txprobe. This is baout discovering the topology of the bitcoin network using orphan transactions. There are a bunch of coauthors and collaborators.
What we know about the topology I want to start by talking a little bit about what we know about the network topology without using txprobe.</description></item><item><title>Unlinkable Outsourced Channel Monitoring</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/unlinkable-outsourced-channel-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/unlinkable-outsourced-channel-monitoring/</guid><description>Unlinkable outsourced channel monitoring

Okay. Hi everyone. Check. Wow. Check one two. Okay it&amp;rsquo;s working. And I have 25 minutes. Great. So I am going to talk about unlinkable outsourced channel modeling. Everyone likes channels. You can update states. You can link them together to make a network. This is really great. There are risks. These are additional risks. The price of scalability is eternal vigilance. You have to keep watching your channels.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading Capital Markets For Digital Asset Trading</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/upgrading-capital-markets-for-digital-asset-trading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/upgrading-capital-markets-for-digital-asset-trading/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

I am Andrew Poelstra, a cryptographer at Blockstream. I am going to talk about scriptless scripts. But this is a specific example of a more general theme, which is using the blockchain as a trust anchor or commitment layer for smart contracts whose real contents don&amp;rsquo;t really hit the blockchain.

Motivation As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen over the last two days scalability is a multidimensional problem. One of the main topics of research is increasing the blocksize to increase transaction throughput. The assumption is that as technological progress is continuing and transaction throughput is increased accordingly, the cost for runnning a fully validating node stays constant.
However, blocksize proposals usually only directly change one aspect of full node costs - the blocksize.</description></item><item><title>Validation Costs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/validation-costs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/validation-costs/</guid><description>Validation costs and incentives

How many of you have read the Satoshi whitepaper? It&amp;rsquo;s a good paper. As we have discovered, it has some serious limitations that we think can be fixed but they are serious challenges for scaling. Amongst these are, it was really built as a single code base which was meant to be run in its entirety. All machines were going to participate equally in this p2p network.</description></item><item><title>Valueshuffle Mixing Confidential Transactions</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/valueshuffle-mixing-confidential-transactions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/valueshuffle-mixing-confidential-transactions/</guid><description>valueshuffle: Mixing confidential transactions

Thank you.
We have seen two talks now about putting privacy in layer two. But let&amp;rsquo;s talk about layer one. We still don&amp;rsquo;t have great privacy there. So the title of this talk is valueshuffle - mixing confidential transactions. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to convince you that bitcoin at the moment is not really private. There are a lot of possibilities to link&amp;hellip; to deal them as, to link addresses together.</description></item><item><title>Visa Chain</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/visa-chain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/coindesk-consensus-2016/visa-chain/</guid><description>Preliminary notes:

Introduction If you find a bug in a smart contract, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to mitigate that bug. In formal verification, we really look for bugs. We can identify subtle bugs, like reentrancy attacks, ownership violation, incorrect transactions, bugs due to updated code. We also want to assure the absence of bugs.

What is weak-signal HF radio? These are called high frequency. That&amp;rsquo;s the official name for these frequencies. Short wave is for historical reasons is longer waves and much higher frequency compared to our wireless internet frequencies. The terminology is backwards. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the ionosphere and how we&amp;rsquo;re bouncing signals off of it. This is really long-range stuff.

Group 1: Decentralized Decentralization is a means of preventing a single point of control existing.
Group 3: Cloud We picked a term preventing decentralized identity. The one that resonated for us was &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;. We equated the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; with the idea of centralized convenience and value creation that businesses and individuals look at the cloud as a great place to be because it&amp;rsquo;s cheap and convenient and all of your dreams are answered in the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2015/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome session

I am luke-jr. I am going to go over why block size shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too big.
How does bitcoin work? Miners put transactrions into blocks. Users verify that the blocks are valid. If the users don&amp;rsquo;t verify this, then miners can do basically anything. Because the users do this, 51% attacks are limited to reorgs which is undoing transactions.</description></item><item><title>Why Miners Will Not Voluntarily Individually Produce Smaller Blocks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/why-miners-will-not-voluntarily-individually-produce-smaller-blocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/why-miners-will-not-voluntarily-individually-produce-smaller-blocks/</guid><description>Jonathan Bier

Marginal cost is very low.
In about 2011, people started discussing the idea of needing an artificial cap for a block size limit to kind of kick up the transaction fees. The orphan risk is a marginal cost the larger the block, the higher the chance of an orphan.
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got some issues why orphan risk may not be so great. As technology improves, over time the technology cost of orphaning gets lower and lower, so you are relying on driving miner revenue or fees, would become less relevant.</description></item><item><title>Work In Progress</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/work-in-progress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/work-in-progress/</guid><description>Work in progress sessions

Bitcoin has logical opcodes in bitcoin script. Depending on whose is trying to spend coins or what information they have, they interact with logical opcodes. We could see a simple example here taken from one of the lightning network commitment transcraction scripts. It pushes a key on to the stack so that a checksig can run later. It adds a relative timelock as well.</description></item><item><title>Zero Knowledge Probabilistic Proof Systems</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/zero-knowledge-probabilistic-proof-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/simons-institute/zero-knowledge-probabilistic-proof-systems/</guid><description>Zero knowledge probabilistic proof systems

Introduction Indeed I am Madars Virza. I am going to talk about SHARKs. I am going to be talking about zero-knowledge SHARKs. It&amp;rsquo;s actually something serious and it&amp;rsquo;s related to non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.
Non-interactive zero knowledge proofs zkproofs are protocols between two parties, a prover and a verifier. Both prover and verifier know a public input, but only the prover knows a secret input as a witness. The prover wants to convince the verifier that some relationship holds between the public input and the secret witness.</description></item><item><title>Zkvm</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/zkvm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/zkvm/</guid><description>ZkVM: zero-knowledge virtual machine for fast confidential smart contracts
