Thank you all for coming. We have some bitcoin contributors here, and some people from the investment community. The impetus for this event was a bitcoin conference this weekend, but also Gideon is speaking today. We went to a blockchain event a few months ago and it was our impression that they didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job of explaining bitcoin to investors. Since we&amp;rsquo;re all up here in Dallas, we thought we would share some perspectives about what bitcoin is and how it works for people that are actively contributing in the space.</description></item><item><title>Q A</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/q-a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/q-a/</guid><description>Q&amp;amp;A session

MB: I have a podcast called Tales from the Crypt where I interview people working on and around bitcoin. I have spoken to many of these gentlemen on the podcast as well. I want to focus on, many of these presentations were focused on history and prehistory of bitcoin. For this Q&amp;amp;A session, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the future of the bitcoin standard. Michael, I want you to talk about the future of the bitcoin standard on a sound money point standpoint, like not having to chase for a store of value like houses.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Developers</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-developers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-developers/</guid><description>Introduction I am going to talk about a programmer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. As investors, you might find this interesting, but at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely actionable. As a programmer, the bitcoin ecosystem is very attractive. This is true of cryptocurrencies in general. I&amp;rsquo;ll make a distinction for bitcoin at the end. One of the interesting things is that you see some of the most talented hackers in the world are extremely attracted to bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Security</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/bitcoin-security/</guid><description>Bitcoin security
Introduction Hi everyone, my name is Dhruv Bansal. I am the CTO of Unchained Capital. Thank you for the history lesson, Tuur. That&amp;rsquo;s a hard act to follow. I keep thinking about how it must have been like to transact large amounts of money back then. It was a fascinating time period. There was a lot of foundations laid for how the global financial system will work later in the future, like fractional reserve lending, loans, and so on.</description></item><item><title>History And Extrapolation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/history-and-extrapolation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/history-and-extrapolation/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sound Money</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/sound-money/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/sound-money/</guid><description>Introduction In 2014, Michael appeared on MSNBC and gave this quote: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d only recommend using altcoins for speculation purposes if you really love risk, you&amp;rsquo;re absolutely in love with risk, and you&amp;rsquo;re interested in watching money disappear.&amp;rdquo; Today my talk is on sound money for the digital age. The concept of monetary economics is the reason why I got interested in bitcoin back in 2012. I still tihnk that&amp;rsquo;s the important thing that makes bitcoin important in the first place.</description></item><item><title>Texas Energy Market</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/texas-energy-market/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/dallas-bitcoin-symposium/texas-energy-market/</guid><description>Bitcoin mining
Bitcoin has been one of the most interesting rides of my life. I come from an oil/gas family. I lived in Midland after college. I became very interested in monetary policy, inflation and its effects on the world. Through that, really discovered bitcoin and what it is capable of doing. I come from the energy perspective and Austrian school of economics.
Mining This is our first large scale project&amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s a 100 MW substation.</description></item></channel></rss>
