Introduction Matteo got sick and couldn&amp;rsquo;t come. His coauthors couldn&amp;rsquo;t come either. So a talk was pre-recorded and will be played now. Our work is about realizing atomic multi-channel updates with constant collateral in bitcoin.
Scalability issues We all know that blockchains have scalability issues. Public verifiability means we have to store each transaction on the blockchain. The transaction rate of bitcoin is far from being satisfactory. We can reach up to about 10 transactions/second in bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Beyond 51% attacks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/beyond-hashrate-majority-attacks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/beyond-hashrate-majority-attacks/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230624835996250112
Introduction Alright let&amp;rsquo;s get started with the next session. Vitalik is from Canada. He is a former writer for Bitcoin Magazine and can often be seen wearing unicorn shirts. He will be telling us about &amp;ldquo;Beyond 51% attacks&amp;rdquo;. Take it away.
Okay, so hello everyone. Hi. Okay. I will start by reminding everyone that 51% attacks are in fact bad. Bear with me for a few minutes. Is this better?</description></item><item><title>Competitive equilibria between staking and on-chain lending</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/competitive-equilibria-staking-lending/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/competitive-equilibria-staking-lending/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230581977289379840

Introduction There have been some odd finanical attacks in the DeFi space and also on staking. This talk aims to show that the threat model for staking is definitively different from that of proof-of-work, and these financial attacks need to be part of the threat model.
Agenda I&amp;rsquo;ll go over some high level overview of intuitive market dynamics, then we will build up an agent-based model that correctly goes across multiple participants to stress test staking situations, then we go through the various assumptions, and at a high-level I&amp;rsquo;ll give some formal probability statements without proofs, and finally I have simulation results to discuss which can give you some idea about how to design a monetary policy.</description></item><item><title>Proof-of-Stake Longest Chain Protocols Revisited</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-stake/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/proof-of-stake/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230646529230163968
Introduction Thanks. I am the last talk of the session so I better make it interesting, and if not interesting then short at least. I am going to talk about proof-of-stake. This is collaboration with a few people. Vivek Bagaria, &amp;hellip; et al.
Proof-of-stake prism The starting point of this project was to come up with a proof-of-stake version of prism, which we just saw in the last talk. Prism has good latency and very high throughput and it also inherits the simplicity of the longest-chain protocol because its security is maintained by the longest chain protocol on each of the 1000 voting chains.</description></item><item><title>Linking Anonymous Transactions via Remote Side-Channel Attacks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/linking-anonymous-transactions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/linking-anonymous-transactions/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230214874908655617

Abstract Metering is an approach developed to assign cost to smart contract execution in blockchain systems such as Ethereum. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the metering approach based on gas taken by the Ethereum blockchain. We discover a number of discrepancies in the metering model such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the instructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation between the gas and resources such as CPU and memory.</description></item><item><title>Arbitrum 2.0: Faster Off-Chain Contracts with On-Chain Security</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/arbitrum-v2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/arbitrum-v2/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230191734375628802
Introduction Thank you, good morning everybody. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about our latest version of our Abitrum system. The first version was discussed in a paper in 2018. Since then, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of advances in my technology and a real running system has been made. This is the first working roll-up system for general smart contracts.
First I will set the scene to provide some context on what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about and how what we&amp;rsquo;re doing fits into the larger picture.</description></item><item><title>Block Rewards</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/block-rewards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/block-rewards/</guid><description>An Axiomatic Approach to Block Rewards

Introduction Thank you, Bram. Can you hear me in the back? I want to talk about some work I have been doing with my colleagues. This is a paper about incentive issues in blockchain protocols. I am interested in thinking about whether protocols have been designed in a way that motivates users to behave in the way that the designer had hoped.</description></item><item><title>Blockchains For Multiplayer Games</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/blockchains-for-multiplayer-games/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/blockchains-for-multiplayer-games/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230256436527034368
Introduction Alright, thanks everyone for being here. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started. I am part of a project called Forte which wants to equip the game ecosystem with blockchain finance for their in-game economies. This is a unique set of constraints compared to what a lot of people are trying to build on blockchain today. We&amp;rsquo;re game experts. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely people more experts than us on the topics we&amp;rsquo;ll cover in this presentation, but what we want you to come away with is our best sense for the best path to get game economies running on blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Boomerang - Redundancy Improves Latency and Throughput in Payment-Channel Network</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/boomerang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/boomerang/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230936389300080640
Introduction Redundancy can be a useful tool for speeding up payment channel networks and improving throughput. We presented last week at Financial Crypto. You just received a nice introduction to payment channels and payment channel networks.
Payment channels Alice and Bob are connected through a payment channel. This is a channel and in that channel there are some coins that are escrowed. Some coins belong to Alice some belong to Bob and they want to transact them back and forth.</description></item><item><title>Brick Async State Channels</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/brick-async-state-channels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/brick-async-state-channels/</guid><description>Brick: Asynchronous State Channels

Introduction I am going to be presenting on Brick for asynchronous state channels. This is joint work with my colleagues and my advisor. So far we have heard many things about payment channels and payment channel networks. They were focused on existing channel solutions. In this work, we focus on a different dimensions. We ask why do payment channels work the way they do, can we change the core design of payment channels to address some of the shortcomings.</description></item><item><title>Celo Ultralight Client</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/celo-ultralight-client/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/celo-ultralight-client/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230261714039398402

https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1231012112517844993
Introduction Clockwork is an exchange protocol for proofs of non-frontrunning.
Exchange systems Exchange systems let you trade one asset for another asset at a certain price. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be fair. In this work, we&amp;rsquo;re focused on centralized exchange systems. We&amp;rsquo;re not working with decentralized exchanges just yet. These don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to be cryptocurrency exchanges, either. Our work applies to both.</description></item><item><title>DECO: Liberating Web Data Using Decentralized Oracles for TLS</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/decentralized-oracles-tls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/decentralized-oracles-tls/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230657639740108806
Introduction I am Fan from Cornell. I am going to be talking about DECO, a privacy-preserving oracle for TLS. This is joint work with some other people.
Decentralized identity What is identity? To use any system, the first thing that the user needs to do is to prove her identity and that she is a user to the system. The identity can be descriptive. You can think of digital identity as a set of descriptions about a user.</description></item><item><title>Finding Bugs Automatically in Smart Contracts with Parameterized Specifications</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/smart-contract-bug-hunting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/smart-contract-bug-hunting/</guid><description>https://www.certora.com/pubs/sbc2020.pdf

Introduction One of the most powerful things that you can do with SNARKs is something called recursive proofs where you actually prove that another SNARK was correct. I can give you a proof of a proof of a proof and this is amazing because you can prove an ever-expanding computation like a blockchain is always correct. I can always give you a proof that you have the latest block and you know the entire blockchain and all the transactions in it are correct.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Accelerated RSA - VDFs, SNARKs, and Accumulators</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/hardware-accelerated-rsa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/hardware-accelerated-rsa/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230551345700069377

Outline I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what acceleration is and why we&amp;rsquo;re interested in it, then we&amp;rsquo;ll get into RSA primitives, then we&amp;rsquo;ll get into algorithms, and then various platforms for hardware. Hardware is anything you&amp;rsquo;re going to run software on. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at what the tradeoffs are, and then some performance numbers and measurements we&amp;rsquo;ve taken.</description></item><item><title>Lower Bounds for Off-Chain Protocols: Exploring the Limits of Plasma</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/lower-bounds-limits-plasma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/lower-bounds-limits-plasma/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230183338746335233

Introduction Groups of unknown order are interesting cryptographic primitives. You can commit to integers. If you commit to a very large integer, you have to do a lot of work to do the commitment so you have a sequentiality assumption useful for VDFs. But then you have this compression property where if you take a large integer with a lot of information in it, you can compress it down to something small.</description></item><item><title>Solving Data Availability Attacks Using Coded Merkle Trees</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/solving-data-availability-attacks-using-coded-merkle-trees/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/solving-data-availability-attacks-using-coded-merkle-trees/</guid><description>Coded Merkle Tree: Solving Data Availability Attacks in Blockchains

Introduction It always seems like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of different proof systems, but it turns out they really work well together and there&amp;rsquo;s great abstractions that are happening where we can take different tools and plug them together. We will see some of those in this session. I think STARKs were first announced 3 years ago back when this conference was BPASE, and now they are ready to use for developers and they are deployed in the wild and it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to see how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come in the past few years.</description></item><item><title>Streamlet: Textbook Streamlined Blockchain Protocols</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/streamlet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/streamlet/</guid><description>((&amp;hellip;. stream went offline in the other room, had to catch up.))

Introduction We&amp;rsquo;re building a new wallet for the system, Calibre, which we are launching. A bit about myself before we get started. I have been at Facebook for about 10 years now. Before Facebook, I was one of the co-founders of reCaptcha- the squiggly letters you type in before you login and register. I have been working at Facebook on performance, reliability, and working with web standards to make the web faster.</description></item><item><title>The optimistic VM</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/optimistic-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/optimistic-vm/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1230974707249233921
Introduction Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get started our afternoon session. Our first talk I am very happy to introduce our speaker on optimistic virtual machines. Earlier in this conference we heard about optimistic roll-ups and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this talk on optimistic virtual machines which is an up-and-coming approach on doing this.
Why hello everyone. I am building on ethereum and in particular we&amp;rsquo;re going to make Optimism: the attitude that will save the day.</description></item><item><title>Transparent Dishonesty: front-running attacks on Blockchain</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/transparent-dishonesty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2020/transparent-dishonesty/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1231005309310627841
Introduction The last two talks are going to be about frontrunning. One of the features of blockchain is that they are slow but this also opens them up to vulnerabilities such that I can insert my transactions before other people and this could have bad consequences and Shayan is going to explore this a little bit.

Introduction Our next speaker is Ben Fisch, part of the Stanford Applied Crypto team and he has done a lot of work that is relevant to the blockchain space. Proofs of replication, proofs of space, he is also one of the coauthors of a paper that defined the notion of verifiable delay functions. He has also worked on accumulators, batching techniques, vector commitments, and one of his latest works is exciting which is DARKs which he is going to talk about today.</description></item></channel></rss>
