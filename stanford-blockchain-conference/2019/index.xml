This is work with my colleagues in addition to myself.
Why aggregate? Distributed systems often require gathering statements about large subsets of nodes. However, processing (filtering, aggregating&amp;hellip;) measurements can be a bottleneck. We want to apply some processing while collecting the measurements.
Why byzantine? A byzantine node is a node that can be arbitrary. It can be offline and it can be anything it wants and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to respect the protocol specification.</description></item><item><title>Building Mimblewimble/Grin, an implementation for privacy and scalability</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-mimblewimble-and-grin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-mimblewimble-and-grin/</guid><description>Quentin Le Sceller (Grin Dev Team), Ignotus Peverell (Grin Dev Team), Yeastplume (Grin Dev Team), Antioch Peverell (Grin Dev Team), HashMap (Grin Dev Team), John Tromp (Grin Dev Team), Daniel Lehnberg (Grin Dev Team)

Our first talk is from the Grin project. It was just launched a few weeks ago. Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Introduction Hi everyone. My name is Quentin Le Sceller. I&amp;rsquo;m a developer at Blockcypher. I am here to talk about grin, specifically about building mimblewimble and grin an implementation for privacy and scalability.</description></item><item><title>Quisquis: A New Design for Anonymous Cryptocurrencies</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/quisquis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/quisquis/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090677466216128512
https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/990
Introduction Good morning. I am here to talk to you about Quisquis which is a new design for an anonymous cryptocurrency. This talk is going to focus on the transaction layer. We don&amp;rsquo;t talk about consensus or smart contracts or higher applications.
Outline I am going to talk about bitcoin and anonymity. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about existing cryptocurrencies that claim to have anonymity and about their limitations. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about our basic solution, where one public key is one coin, updateable public keys, and N-to-N transactions without interactions.</description></item><item><title>SybilQuorum: Open Distributed Ledgers Through Trust Networks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/sybilquorum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/sybilquorum/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090777875253407745
Introduction This is joint work with George Danezis who couldn&amp;rsquo;t be here today and also cofounded Chainspace. Among all the possible challenges we may have on a blockchain, this talk will be about how to build strong sybil resistance. We would consider a subset of the problem, how will we bootstrap a federated agreement system?
Sybil attacks I am sure everyone knows about sybil attacks. Imagine you have a classic setting where you have an attacker creating fake identities.</description></item><item><title>Plasma Cash</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/plasma-cash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/plasma-cash/</guid><description>Plasma Cash: Towards more efficient Plasma constructions

Shi: Okay, we&amp;rsquo;re going to start the next session. Please return to your seats. I have an important announcement before the session starts. Because of the fire code, we can&amp;rsquo;t allow people standing room. Please go to the overflow rooms at the end of the hallway. We don&amp;rsquo;t want the fire marshall to come and shutdown the conference. Also, the acoustics of the room make it so that we can hear the details of your conversations in the back.</description></item><item><title>Accumulators for blockchains</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/accumulators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/accumulators/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090748293234094082

paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188
Introduction I am going to be talking about batching techniques for accumulators with applications to interactive oracle proofs and blockchains. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe also talk about how to make these proofs even smaller. The main thing that we are going to focus on today is the bitcoin state and this application of accumulators to bitcoin and blockchain.
Bitcoin UTXO states The bitcoin state is the UTXO set.</description></item><item><title>Asics</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/asics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/asics/</guid><description>ASIC design for mining
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091056727464697856
Introduction My name is David Vorick. I am lead developer of Sia, a decentralized cloud storage solution. I come from the software side of the world, but I got into hardware. I think from the perspective of cryptocurrency developers. I am also CEO of Obelisk, which is a cryptocurrency ASIC miner manufacturing company. I was asked today to talk about cryptocurrency ASICs. This is a really broad topic and the format that I have chosen is that I am going to blast through as much as I can, and I&amp;rsquo;ll leave more time for Q&amp;amp;A at the time and have something closer to an open forum so hopefully we can get 10-15 minutes of Q&amp;amp;A at the end.</description></item><item><title>Aurora: Transparent Succinct Arguments for R1CS</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/aurora-transparent-succinct-arguments-r1cs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/aurora-transparent-succinct-arguments-r1cs/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090741190100545536
Introduction Hi. I am Alessandro Chiesa, a faculty member at UC Berkeley. I work on cryptography. I&amp;rsquo;m also a chief scientist at Starkware. I was a founder of zcash. Today I will like to tell you about recent work in cryptographic proof systems. This is joint work with people at Starkware, UC Berkeley, MIT Media Lab, and others. In the prior talk, we talked about scalability. But this current talk is more about privacy by using cryptographic proofs.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Detection of Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/vulnerability-detection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/vulnerability-detection/</guid><description>Introduction If you find a bug in a smart contract, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to mitigate that bug. In formal verification, we really look for bugs. We can identify subtle bugs, like reentrancy attacks, ownership violation, incorrect transactions, bugs due to updated code. We also want to assure the absence of bugs.
Device drivers I come from the domain of Windows device drivers. These are drivers produced by third parties, and it integrates with operating system code.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Payment Economic Analysis</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bitcoin-payment-economic-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bitcoin-payment-economic-analysis/</guid><description>Economic analysis of the bitcoin payment system
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091133843518582787
Introduction I am an economist. I am going to stop apologizing about this now that I&amp;rsquo;ve said it once. I usually study market design. Bitcoin gives us new opportunities for how to design marketplaces. Regarding the talk title, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to claim that bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will be a monopoly. But to be a monopoly, it would behave very differently from traditional monopolies.</description></item><item><title>Bloxroute</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</guid><description>bloXroute: A network for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s blockchain
Introduction Hi. I am Souyma and I am here to talk with you about Bloxroute. The elephant in the room is that blockchains have been claimed to solve everything like credit cards, social media, and global micropayments. To handle credit card payment volumes, blockchains need like 5000 transactions per second, for microtransactions you need 70000 transactions per second, and for social media even more. Blockchains today do about 10 transactions/second.</description></item><item><title>Building Bulletproofs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-bulletproofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-bulletproofs/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090668746073563136
Introduction There are two parts to this talk. The first part of the talk will be building, like all the pieces we put into making the implementation of bulletproofs. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the group we used, the Ristretto group and ristretto255 group. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about parallel lelliptic curve arithmetic, and Merlin transcripts for zero-knowledge proofs, and how all these pieces fit together.
Cathie will talk in part two about constraint system proofs, cloak for a confidential assets protocol, ZkVM for zero-knowledge contracts, and aggregation multi-party computation with session types to aggregate proofs and have faster verification.</description></item><item><title>Casper the Friendly Ghost: A 'Correct-by-Construction' Blockchain Consensus Protocol</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/casper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/casper/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091460316288868352
I have one announcement to make before we start the session. If you feel like after all of these talks that the thing you really need is a drink, then there&amp;rsquo;s help. Chainlink is hosting the Stanford Blockchain Conference happy hour at The Patio which is the most famous bar in Palo Alto. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that much, but it&amp;rsquo;s good fun. It&amp;rsquo;s at 412 Evans St in Palo Alto, from 5-8pm and it&amp;rsquo;s an open bar.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Upgrades</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/coordinated-upgrades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/coordinated-upgrades/</guid><description>Blockchain upgrades as a coordination game
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091139621000339456
Introduction My name is Stephanie Hurder. Today I am going to talk about my paper, blockchain upgrade as a coordination game. This takes an economic lense to the question of how to design blockchain governance. This work was done at Prysm Group and my coauthors. We help blockchains with their governance design. I have a PhD in economics from Harvard where I shared office space with Jacob who just spoke.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Distributed Key Generation for Threshold Signatures</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/threshold-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/threshold-signatures/</guid><description>Threshold signatures Threshold signature schemes are schemes where n parties and at least t are necessary and sufficient for signing. They want to make sure that t parties are necessary. Any threshold signature scheme typically has 3 protocols: key generation, signing, and verifying.
In key generation, one party creates a group public key as an output. Also, for each node that participates in the protocol, the protocol should output a secret key.</description></item><item><title>Ethereum 2.0 and beyond</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/ethereum2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/ethereum2/</guid><description>Please welcome Vitalik who needs no introduction.
Introduction Okay. I have 20 minutes. I will get right to it. Vlad gave a presentation on some of his research into CBC Casper and how CBC Casper can be extended into sharding contexts. This presentation will be about taking some of the existing research into consensus algorithms and sharding and other things we have done in the last few years and see how they concretely translate into what is actually going to be deployed to Ethereum Foundation in the short to medium term future.</description></item><item><title>Formal verification: the road to complete security of smart contracts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/formal-verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/formal-verification/</guid><description>slides: https://twitter.com/MartinLundfall/status/1091119463276064769
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091103595016085504
Introduction Thank you everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to be here speaking about formal verification. The road to complete security of smart contracts is a sensationalist title. I&amp;rsquo;ll be spending a few moments making a huge disclaimer.
Disclaimer This can only be interpreted as a very long road or a very narrow sense in which complete security is actually cheap. There&amp;rsquo;s still a sense of completeness, which is one of the aspects I want to focus on in this talk.</description></item><item><title>Htlcs Considered Harmful</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091033955824881664
Introduction I am here to talk about a design pattern that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. You see HTLCs a lot. You see them in a lot of protocols for cross-chain atomic exchanges and payment channel networks such as lightning. But they have some downsides, which people aren&amp;rsquo;t all familiar with. I am not affiliated with Interledger, but they convinced me that HTLCs were a bad idea and they developed an alternative to replace HTLCs.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/links/</guid><description>info: https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19</description></item><item><title>Miniscript</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/miniscript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/miniscript/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091116834219151360
Jeremy: Our next speaker really needs no introduction. However, I am obligated to deliver an introduction anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m not just trying to avoid pronouncing his name which is known to be unpronounceable. I am pleased to welcome Pieter Wuille to stage to present on miniscript.
Introduction Thanks, Jeremy. I am Pieter Wuille. I work at Blockstream. I do various things. Today I will be talking about miniscript, which is a joint effort between myself and some colleagues at Blockstream particularly Andrew Poelstra.</description></item><item><title>New and Simple Consensus Algorithms for ThunderCore’s Main-Net</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090773938479624192
Introduction Synchronous with a chance of partition tolerance. Thank you for inviting me. I am going to be talking about some new updates. It&amp;rsquo;s joint work with my collaborators. The problem is state-machine replication, sometimes called blockchain or consensus. These terms are going to be the same thing in this talk. The nodes are trying to agree on a linearly updated transaction log.
State-machine replication We care about consistency and liveness.</description></item><item><title>Opening Remarks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/opening-remarks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/opening-remarks/</guid><description>Opening remarks

http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/multi-hop-locks/
Introduction This is joint work with my collaborators. Permissionless blockchains have some issues. The permissionless nature leads to the transaction rate that they have. This limits widespread adoption of blockchain technology like bitcoin or ethereum. Scalability approaches can be roughly grouped into two groups, one is on-chain layer 1 solutions. The other group is off-chain layer 2, which is the focus of this talk today.</description></item><item><title>Spork: Probabilistic Bitcoin Soft Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/spork-probabilistic-bitcoin-soft-forks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/spork-probabilistic-bitcoin-soft-forks/</guid><description>Introduction Thank you for the introduction. I have a secret. I am not an economist, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to forgive me if I don&amp;rsquo;t have your favorite annotations today. I have my own annotations. I originally gave a predecessor to this talk in Japan. You might notice my title here is a haiku: these are protocols used for changing the bitcoin netwokr protocols.

https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091042382072532992
Introduction I am an assistant professor at King&amp;rsquo;s College London. There are many collaborators on this project. Also IC3. Who here has heard of state channels before? Okay, about half of the audience. Let me remove some misconceptions around them.
Scalability problems in bitcoin Why are state channels necessary for cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies do not scale. Bitcoin supports 10 transactions/second, ethereum is 12 transactions/second sort of depending on how big your transaction is going to be.</description></item><item><title>The STARK truth about DEXes</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/stark-dex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/stark-dex/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090731793395798016

Introduction This talk is about proofs of space and tight proofs of space.
Proof of Space A proof-of-space is an alternative to proof-of-work. Applications have been proposed like spam prevention, DoS attack prevention, sybil resistance in consensus networks which is most relevant to this conference. In proof-of-space, it&amp;rsquo;s an interactive protocol between a miner and a prover who has some disk storage and claims that hey I am storing 1 gigabyte of data.</description></item><item><title>Urkel Trees</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/urkel-trees/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/urkel-trees/</guid><description>Urkel trees: An optimized and cryptographically provable key-value store for decentralized naming
