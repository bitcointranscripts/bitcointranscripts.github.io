Shi: Okay, we&amp;rsquo;re going to start the next session. Please return to your seats. I have an important announcement before the session starts. Because of the fire code, we can&amp;rsquo;t allow people standing room. Please go to the overflow rooms at the end of the hallway. We don&amp;rsquo;t want the fire marshall to come and shutdown the conference. Also, the acoustics of the room make it so that we can hear the details of your conversations in the back.</description></item><item><title>Accumulators</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/accumulators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/accumulators/</guid><description>Accumulators for blockchains

paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188
Introduction I am going to be talking about batching techniques for accumulators with applications to interactive oracle proofs and blockchains. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe also talk about how to make these proofs even smaller. The main thing that we are going to focus on today is the bitcoin state and this application of accumulators to bitcoin and blockchain.
Bitcoin UTXO states The bitcoin state is the UTXO set.</description></item><item><title>Asics</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/asics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/asics/</guid><description>ASIC design for mining

Introduction My name is David Vorick. I am lead developer of Sia, a decentralized cloud storage solution. I come from the software side of the world, but I got into hardware. I think from the perspective of cryptocurrency developers. I am also CEO of Obelisk, which is a cryptocurrency ASIC miner manufacturing company. I was asked today to talk about cryptocurrency ASICs. This is a really broad topic and the format that I have chosen is that I am going to blast through as much as I can, and I&amp;rsquo;ll leave more time for Q&amp;amp;A at the time and have something closer to an open forum so hopefully we can get 10-15 minutes of Q&amp;amp;A at the end.</description></item><item><title>Aurora Transparent Succinct Arguments R1Cs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/aurora-transparent-succinct-arguments-r1cs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/aurora-transparent-succinct-arguments-r1cs/</guid><description>Aurora: Transparent succinct arguments for R1CS

Introduction Hi. I am Alessandro Chiesa, a faculty member at UC Berkeley. I work on cryptography. I&amp;rsquo;m also a chief scientist at Starkware. I was a founder of zcash. Today I will like to tell you about recent work in cryptographic proof systems. This is joint work with people at Starkware, UC Berkeley, MIT Media Lab, and others. In the prior talk, we talked about scalability.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Payment Economic Analysis</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bitcoin-payment-economic-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bitcoin-payment-economic-analysis/</guid><description>Economic analysis of the bitcoin payment system
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091133843518582787
Introduction I am an economist. I am going to stop apologizing about this now that I&amp;rsquo;ve said it once. I usually study market design. Bitcoin gives us new opportunities for how to design marketplaces. Regarding the talk title, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to claim that bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will be a monopoly. But to be a monopoly, it would behave very differently from traditional monopolies.</description></item><item><title>Bloxroute</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</guid><description>bloXroute: A network for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s blockchain
Introduction Hi. I am Souyma and I am here to talk with you about Bloxroute. The elephant in the room is that blockchains have been claimed to solve everything like credit cards, social media, and global micropayments. To handle credit card payment volumes, blockchains need like 5000 transactions per second, for microtransactions you need 70000 transactions per second, and for social media even more. Blockchains today do about 10 transactions/second.</description></item><item><title>Building Bulletproofs</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-bulletproofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-bulletproofs/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090668746073563136
Introduction There are two parts to this talk. The first part of the talk will be building, like all the pieces we put into making the implementation of bulletproofs. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the group we used, the Ristretto group and ristretto255 group. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about parallel lelliptic curve arithmetic, and Merlin transcripts for zero-knowledge proofs, and how all these pieces fit together.
Cathie will talk in part two about constraint system proofs, cloak for a confidential assets protocol, ZkVM for zero-knowledge contracts, and aggregation multi-party computation with session types to aggregate proofs and have faster verification.</description></item><item><title>Building Mimblewimble And Grin</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-mimblewimble-and-grin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-mimblewimble-and-grin/</guid><description>Building mimblewimble and green

Introduction Thank you everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to be here speaking about formal verification. The road to complete security of smart contracts is a sensationalist title. I&amp;rsquo;ll be spending a few moments making a huge disclaimer.
Disclaimer This can only be interpreted as a very long road or a very narrow sense in which complete security is actually cheap.</description></item><item><title>Handel Practical Multisig Aggregation</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/handel-practical-multisig-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/handel-practical-multisig-aggregation/</guid><description>Handel: Practical multi-signature aggregation for large byzantine committees
Introduction Handle is a aggregation protocol for large scale byzantine committees. This is work with my colleagues in addition to myself.
Why aggregate? Distributed systems often require gathering statements about large subsets of nodes. However, processing (filtering, aggregating&amp;hellip;) measurements can be a bottleneck. We want to apply some processing while collecting the measurements.
Why byzantine? A byzantine node is a node that can be arbitrary.</description></item><item><title>Htlcs Considered Harmful</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091033955824881664
Introduction I am here to talk about a design pattern that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. You see HTLCs a lot. You see them in a lot of protocols for cross-chain atomic exchanges and payment channel networks such as lightning. But they have some downsides, which people aren&amp;rsquo;t all familiar with. I am not affiliated with Interledger, but they convinced me that HTLCs were a bad idea and they developed an alternative to replace HTLCs.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/links/</guid><description>info: https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19</description></item><item><title>Miniscript</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/miniscript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/miniscript/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091116834219151360

http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/multi-hop-locks/
Introduction This is joint work with my collaborators. Permissionless blockchains have some issues. The permissionless nature leads to the transaction rate that they have. This limits widespread adoption of blockchain technology like bitcoin or ethereum. Scalability approaches can be roughly grouped into two groups, one is on-chain layer 1 solutions. The other group is off-chain layer 2, which is the focus of this talk today.</description></item><item><title>Proofs Of Space And Replication</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/proofs-of-space-and-replication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/proofs-of-space-and-replication/</guid><description>Tight proofs of space and and replication
Ben Fisch (Stanford University)
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091064672831234048
paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/702.pdf
Introduction This talk is about proofs of space and tight proofs of space.
Proof of Space A proof-of-space is an alternative to proof-of-work. Applications have been proposed like spam prevention, DoS attack prevention, sybil resistance in consensus networks which is most relevant to this conference. In proof-of-space, it&amp;rsquo;s an interactive protocol between a miner and a prover who has some disk storage and claims that hey I am storing 1 gigabyte of data.</description></item><item><title>Quisquis - A new design for anonymous cryptocurrencies</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/quisquis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/quisquis/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1090677466216128512

Introduction Good morning. I am here to talk to you about Quisquis which is a new design for an anonymous cryptocurrency. This talk is going to focus on the transaction layer. We don&amp;rsquo;t talk about consensus or smart contracts or higher applications.
Outline I am going to talk about bitcoin and anonymity. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about existing cryptocurrencies that claim to have anonymity and about their limitations. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about our basic solution, where one public key is one coin, updateable public keys, and N-to-N transactions without interactions.</description></item><item><title>Spork Probabilistic Bitcoin Soft Forks</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/spork-probabilistic-bitcoin-soft-forks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/spork-probabilistic-bitcoin-soft-forks/</guid><description>Spork: Probabilistic bitcoin soft-forks
Introduction Thank you for the introduction. I have a secret. I am not an economist, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to forgive me if I don&amp;rsquo;t have your favorite annotations today. I have my own annotations. I originally gave a predecessor to this talk in Japan. You might notice my title here is a haiku: these are protocols used for changing the bitcoin netwokr protocols.

Introduction I am an assistant professor at King&amp;rsquo;s College London. There are many collaborators on this project. Also IC3. Who here has heard of state channels before? Okay, about half of the audience. Let me remove some misconceptions around them.
Scalability problems in bitcoin Why are state channels necessary for cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies do not scale. Bitcoin supports 10 transactions/second, ethereum is 12 transactions/second sort of depending on how big your transaction is going to be.</description></item><item><title>Sybilquorum</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/sybilquorum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/sybilquorum/</guid><description>SybilQuorum: Open distributed ledgers through trust networks

Threshold signatures Threshold signature schemes are schemes where n parties and at least t are necessary and sufficient for signing. They want to make sure that t parties are necessary. Any threshold signature scheme typically has 3 protocols: key generation, signing, and verifying.
In key generation, one party creates a group public key as an output. Also, for each node that participates in the protocol, the protocol should output a secret key.</description></item><item><title>Thundercore</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</guid><description>Thundercore consensus

Introduction Synchronous with a chance of partition tolerance. Thank you for inviting me. I am going to be talking about some new updates. It&amp;rsquo;s joint work with my collaborators. The problem is state-machine replication, sometimes called blockchain or consensus. These terms are going to be the same thing in this talk. The nodes are trying to agree on a linearly updated transaction log.

Mooly Sagiv
Introduction If you find a bug in a smart contract, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to mitigate that bug. In formal verification, we really look for bugs. We can identify subtle bugs, like reentrancy attacks, ownership violation, incorrect transactions, bugs due to updated code. We also want to assure the absence of bugs.
Device drivers I come from the domain of Windows device drivers.</description></item></channel></rss>
