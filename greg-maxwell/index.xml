Introduction Thank you.
So as mentioned, I am going to be talking about confidential transactions today. And I look at confidential transactions as a building block fundamental piece of technology, it&amp;rsquo;s not like altcoin or something like that. It&amp;rsquo;s not a turnkey system, it&amp;rsquo;s some fundamental tech, and there are many different ways to use it and deploy it.
My interest in this technology is primarily driven by bitcoin, but the technology here could be applied to many other things, including things outside of the cryptocurrency space.</description></item><item><title>Gmaxwell - Deep Dive Bitcoin Core V0.15 (2017-08-28)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2017-08-28-gmaxwell-deep-dive-bitcoin-core-v0.15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2017-08-28-gmaxwell-deep-dive-bitcoin-core-v0.15/</guid><description>A deep dive into Bitcoin Core v0.15

Should we be more concerned by the prospect of a 51 percent mining attack? I think questions like this are ultimately the result of a fundamental lack of understanding about what Bitcoin is doing.
The problem Bitcoin is attempting to solve is getting everyone everywhere to agree on the same stable history of transactions.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - bech32 design (2017-12-22)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2017-12-22-bech32-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2017-12-22-bech32-design/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

bech32 design Bech32 is designed for human use and basically nothing else, the only consideration for QR codes is that all caps is also permitted.
For all your talk of human considerations you give a strong signal of having seldom actually used bitcoin addresses as a human. 1/3 type addresses are full of visually confusing characters and the case modulations are a pain to read and enter correctly.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - Bitcoin Core Github (2020-10-26)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-10-26-greg-maxwell-bitcoin-core-github/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-10-26-greg-maxwell-bitcoin-core-github/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

Can GitHub censor Bitcoin Core? The event isn&amp;rsquo;t news to Bitcoin developers either, github has done this a number of times before&amp;ndash; even taking Mozilla offline as a result of an obviously spurious DMCA complaint.

Bitcoin Core testing I believe slower would potentially result in less testing and not likely result in more at this point.
If we had an issue that newly introduced features were turning out to frequently have serious bugs that are discovered shortly after shipping there might be a case that it would improve the situation to delay improvements more before putting them into critical operation&amp;hellip; but I think we&amp;rsquo;ve been relatively free of such issues.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - Checkmultisig Bug (2020-08-27)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-08-27-greg-maxwell-checkmultisig-bug/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-08-27-greg-maxwell-checkmultisig-bug/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

What is stopping the OP_CHECKMULTISIG extra pop bug from being fixed? I think it is probably wrong to describe it as a bug. I think it was intended to indicate which signatures were present to fix the otherwise terrible performance of CHECKMULTISIG.
Regardless, there is no real point to fixing it: Any &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; would require that all software using CHECKMULTISIG get an incompatible change (as part of a highly disruptive hard fork).</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - Covenants and BIP119 (2022–05-05)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2022-05-05-covenants-bip119/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2022-05-05-covenants-bip119/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

Covenants and BIP119 I was asked by an old colleague to respond to your post because I came up with the term covenant as applied Bitcoin many years ago back when I was still a Bitcoin developer.
does bip 119 completely mess the fungibility of bitcoin.

Why do hardware wallets not support altcoins? They&amp;rsquo;re an enormous distraction and hazard to software development. It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough to correctly and safely write software to support one system. Every minute spent creating and testing the software for some alternative is a minute taken away from supporting Bitcoin.
I can say first hand that my efforts to review hardware wallet code against possible vulnerabilities have been actively thwarted by hardware wallet codebases being crapped up with support for altcoins.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - libsecp256k1 testing (2015–01-08)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-01-08-libsecp256k1-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-01-08-libsecp256k1-testing/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

Is Liquid censorship resistant? Liquid isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly censorship resistant. If someone tells you it is they&amp;rsquo;re confused.
Back when I worked at Blockstream there was thought in the design to mitigate some of the risks: make transactions difficult to identify, even the peg outs use a ring signature to authorize them, and Blockstream should have no ability to change the software in use (instead, they&amp;rsquo;d have to convince each of the functionaries to run replacement software if they wanted it deployed&amp;ndash; and the software is open source).</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - Multiple Implementations (2018-09-23)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2018-09-23-greg-maxwell-multiple-implementations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2018-09-23-greg-maxwell-multiple-implementations/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

Risks of multiple implementations They would create more risk. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is any reason to doubt that this is an objective fact which has been borne out by the history.
First, failures in software are not independent. For example, when BU nodes were crashing due to xthin bugs, classic were also vulnerable to effectively the same bug even though their code was different and some triggers that would crash one wouldn&amp;rsquo;t crash the other.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - OpenSSL bug discovery (2015–01-08)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-01-08-openssl-bug/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2015-01-08-openssl-bug/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

OpenSSL bug discovery I contributed to the discovery and analysis of CVE-2014-3570 &amp;ldquo;Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results&amp;rdquo;. In this case, the issue was that one of the carry propagation conditions was missed. The bug was discovered as part of the development of libsecp256k1, a high performance (and hopefully high quality: correct, complete, side-channel resistant) implementation of the cryptographic operators used by Bitcoin, developed primarily by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille along with a number of other people.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell - Replacing PGP (2020-11-25)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-11-25-greg-maxwell-replacing-pgp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/2020-11-25-greg-maxwell-replacing-pgp/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

Is PGP replaceable with Bitcoin public key infrastructure? This is true in the same sense that PGP can also be replaced with some fancy functions on a school kids graphing calculator.
Yes you can construct some half-assed imitation of pgp using stuff from Bitcoin, but you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.

Why can’t hash power be used for something useful? There is a general game theory reason why this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out:
Imagine that you are considering attempting to reorder the chain to undo a transaction.

Yubikey Security By this logic, a yubikey would also be a great targeting vector.
They would be, and if US intelligence services have not compromised yubis or at least have a perfect targeted substitution solutions for them then they should all be fired for gross incompetence and mismanagement of their funding.
Likewise, if parties which things of significant value to secure who might be targeted by state level attackers are securing those things with just yubs instead of using yubis as a second factor in an otherwise secure setup then those parties ought to be fired too.</description></item></channel></rss>
