Introduction This talk is the second in the series after my previous talk in London a few months ago at the Advancing Bitcoin conference. There I was talking mostly about general attacks on hardware, more from the theoretical perspective. I didn’t say anything bad hardware wallets that exist and I didn’t specify anything on the bad side.</description></item><item><title>Sjors Provoost - Bitcoin Core and hardware wallets (2018-09-19)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-09-19-sjors-provoost-core-hardware-wallet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-09-19-sjors-provoost-core-hardware-wallet/</guid><description>Name: Sjors Provoost

Introduction I am Sjors, I am going to show you how to use, you probably shouldn’t try this at home, the Bitcoin Core wallet directly with a hardware wallet. Most of that work is done by Andrew Chow. I’m just showing how it works. I will have some thoughts of my own on how that could be made more user friendly.</description></item><item><title>Adam Gibson - Unfairly Linear Signatures (2018-06-12)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-06-12-adam-gibson-unfairly-linear-signatures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-06-12-adam-gibson-unfairly-linear-signatures/</guid><description>Name: Adam Gibson

Intro This is supposed to be a developer meetup but this talk is going to be a little more on the theoretical side. The title is “Unfairly Linear Signatures” that is just a joke. It is talking about Schnorr signatures. They are something that could in the near future have a big practical significance in Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Alex Bosworth - Submarine Swaps (2019-07-03)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-07-03-alex-bosworth-submarine-swaps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-07-03-alex-bosworth-submarine-swaps/</guid><description>Alex Bosworth

Intro Thanks for inviting me. I’m going to talk about submarine swaps and Lightning Loop which is something that I work on at Lightning Labs.
Bitcoin - One Currency, Multiple Settlement Networks Something that is pretty important to understand about Lightning is that it is a flow network so once you set up your channels and you’re in a network of channels with other people, the balances can only shift along flow properties of the network.</description></item><item><title>Andrew Chow Hardware Wallets (2020-02-05)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-05-andrew-chow-hardware-wallets/</guid><description>Andrew Chow

Introduction As Michael mentioned I’ve got like two hours. Hopefully I won’t get close to that but you guys are welcome to interrupt and ask questions. I’ve given a couple of talks about Miniscript usually in like 20 or 30 minute time slots where I try to give a high level overview of what this project is, why should you use it and why it makes Bitcoin script accessible in ways that it hasn’t been.</description></item><item><title>Gleb Naumenko - Erlay (2019-11-13)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-11-13-gleb-naumenko-p2p-erlay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2019-11-13-gleb-naumenko-p2p-erlay/</guid><description>Gleb Naumenko

Introduction My name is Gleb. I’ve worked on Bitcoin stuff since 2015, building wallets and exchanges in Ukraine. Then I realized that I can do more fun stuff. I want to do more protocol research, improving Bitcoin itself, not just using it. I decided I will go to Canada to do a Masters. I started working on this topic on research stuff more precisely and I realized that not many people do work on peer-to-peer (P2P) of Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>James Chiang Trace Net (2020-02-04)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-04-james-chiang-trace-net/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-04-james-chiang-trace-net/</guid><description>Name: James Chiang

Intro Good evening. My name is James and it is a real privilege to give this talk right after Andrew (Poelstra) has primed the entire audience on Miniscript. That’s pretty awesome. I learned a lot of things even though I coded the stuff that they have on Pieter’s website the actual justification and reasoning behind a lot of the decisions they made in the language were very insightful.</description></item><item><title>Jnewbery Bitcoin Core V0.17</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/jnewbery-bitcoin-core-v0.17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/jnewbery-bitcoin-core-v0.17/</guid><description>Bitcoin Core v0.17
